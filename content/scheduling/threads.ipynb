    "# How are threads different?\n",
    "\n",
    "A core part of the UNIX model is separation of processes, or to be more specific, one running process should not be able to directly interact with the resources (memory, etc.) owned by another process without explicitly being setup to do so. This model is great for simple processes which do not need to utilize multiple CPUs, but it can make writing programs to use multiple CPUs more difficult as memory must be explicitly shared or processes must use another form of communication. A *thread* is like a process in that it has its own PCB, however, unlike a process it does not have its own address space. Instead threads all belong to a process and share the address space of that process so any changes made to memory by one thread are visible to all the other threads belonging to the same process."
