    "## Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind priority scheduling is that some processes may be more important than others and should be given access to the CPU first. To implement this policy, the OS maintains two or more priority queues which hold processes assigned to the corresponding priority. Runnable processes in a higher priority queue are run before runnable processes in lower priority queues. In general we assign higher priorities to I/O bound processes and lower priorities to CPU bound ones. Figure {numref}`priority-sched` shows a simple example of a system with 4 priority queues. In this snapshot, the next process to be given CPU time will be the first process in the priority 4 queue. Assuming no additions, the processes in queue 3 will not run until all of the ones in 4 have completed.\n",

    "```{Note}\n",
    "It may seem counter-intuitive to assign high priority to I/O bound processes because they often do not make use of their full time slice. We do this because a process that is frequently blocking on I/O is more likely to be interactive and therefore have a user who will notice latency when the scheduler ignores the process for several periods.\n",
