    "## Shell\n",
    "The shell is a basic interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel and any installed programs. Whenever you open a terminal, the kernel starts an instance of a shell program, or shell \"session\". When most people interact with computers, they do so through graphical user interfaces that they navigate using a mouse or their finger. The shell is completely text-based and designed for programmers. It has its own programming language of special commands to access kernel functionalities. For more information about terminals and shells, please refer to the relevant sections of [the following textbook](https://jappavoo.github.io/UndertheCovers/textbook/unix/intro.html#operating-systems-and-unix).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will introduce several shell commands that you will see and use very frequently. We encourage you to experiment with all of the commands and examples covered in this section! It is by far the best way to become comfortable with the shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some basic shell commands\n",
    "#### Help and information\n",
    "##### `man <command>`\n",
    "This is probably the most important command for students new to Linux and interacting with computers via the shell. The `man` command (short for \"manual\") allows you to access documentation about all programs installed on a system. For example, to view documentation for the `man` command itself, you simply type `man man` to open its man page. You can scroll through man pages using the arrow keys or `ctrl+f` (move forward one page) and `ctrl+b` (move backward one page) and exit back to the command line by typing `q`. For more information about any of the other commands discussed in this chapter (or any chapter for that matter), consult these **man pages**!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigating your system via the command line \n",
    "The shell provides us with a way to navigate through our machine's file directory. When you open a new terminal in the development environment, you will be in your **home directory**. The directory that you are in at any given time is called the **working directory**. To see what your current working directory is, simply type `pwd` into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pwd \n",
    "/home/username \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to reference files and directories in the shell. The first is using **absolute paths**. When referring to directories this way, you have to write the entire path to the desired directory starting at the root `/`. The advantage to this approach is that these references remain static no matter where you are in the system. As long as you don't move a file, it's absolute path remains the same. To change your working directory, you can use the `cd` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd /home\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command does not print anything to the command line, but if you rerun `pwd` you will see that the working directory has changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option for referencing files is to use **relative paths**. They are called relative paths because they are written *relative* to your current working directory. Thus, the path to the file of interest depends on your working directory. The advantage to using relative paths is that they are generally much shorter than absolute paths. In addition, there are some nice shortcuts you can use if you aren't trying to move too far away from your current working directory. For example, if I want to move to the parent directory of my working directory, I can simply type `cd ..` instead of writing out the whole path of the parent directory. When moving into the child directory of the current working directory, you can just type `cd child` or `cd child/grandchild` and the shell will know that you are using a relative path since it does not start with a `/`. Typing `cd child` is equivalent to typing `cd ./child`, since `.` is used to denote the current working directory. You can also get to the \"grandparent\" directory by typing `cd ../..` or one of your parent directory's other children using the command `cd ../sibling`. To go to your home directory, you can type `cd ~`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to view the contents of a directory. You can do this using the `ls` command. If you provide it with no arguments, it will simply print the contents of your working directory. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "file1.txt file2.txt hw1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The directories will be differentiated from the plain files in the development environment with bold colored text. You can also provide an absolute or relative path as an argument to the `ls` command (e.g., `ls /path/to/directory/`) to see the contents of a different directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recap:\n",
    "* All file paths start at the root directory `/` and you can reference them absolutely or using relative paths\n",
    "* Your home directory is `~`, the current working directory is `.`, and the parent of the working directory is `..`\n",
    "* `pwd`: prints your working directory\n",
    "* `cd /some/directory`: move to the specified directory\n",
    "* `ls /some/directory`: print the files and directories within the chosen directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating, viewing, and manipulating files and directories\n",
    "* `touch <desiredfilename>`: create a new file. \n",
    "* `cat <filename>`: print contents of a file to the terminal.\n",
    "* `mv /path/to/<filename> /desired/path/to/file/`: move a file to a different directory. To move a directory instead of just a single file, use the flag `-r`. \n",
    "* `cp <filename> <filecopyname>`: make a copy of an existing file. \n",
    "* `mdkir <desireddirectoryname>`: create a new directory. \n",
    "* `emacs <filename>`: open the file \"filename\" in the EMACS editor. More on this in the following section.\n",
    "* `wc <filename>`: print newline, word, and byte counts for a file. To see just the word count, add the flag `-w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous\n",
    "##### `echo`\n",
    "Display a line of text to standard out. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo \"Hello world\"\n",
    "Hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### `ctrl+c`\n",
    "This will terminate whatever process/command is currently running in the shell. Great if you think your code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is just taking much longer than you thought it would to finish running. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symbols\n",
    "##### |\n",
    "This is known as the \"pipe\" symbol and is used to redirect the output of one command into the input of a second command. For example, if I type `ls .. | wc -w`, the total number of files/directories in the `..` directory will be printed to the command line. \n",
    "##### >\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-out to a command. For example, if I type: `echo \"Hello world\" > hw.txt`, instead of printing \"Hello world\" to the terminal, the right carrot symbol would direct that output into the file \"hw.txt\". \n",
    "##### <\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-in to a command.\n",
    "`hw.txt < wc`"

    "## Editors\n",
    "Terminal-based text editors allow us to write and edit files when we don't have access to a GUI (e.g., when we are SSHing into a remote computer). [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and [EMACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) are most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to have basic knowledge of one of these editors so you can make small, quick changes to files and only minimally interrupt your workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "### VIM Basics\n",
    "VIM is entirely text-based and has two main modes of operation: *command mode* and *insert mode*. To open a file in VIM, you type `vim <filename>`. If a file by that name does not exist, it will be created for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will open vim in *command mode*. To edit the file, you can type `i` to enter *insert mode*. At that point you can navigate the cursor with the arrow keys and type just as you would a regular text document. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished making changes, type `:` to go back to command mode. To save and quit, you just type `wq` (write and quit commands) and press enter and VIM will exit back to the main terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many additional commands and shortcuts in VIM (look up VIM cheatsheets and you'll find plenty), but this is enough to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "### EMACS Basics\n",
    "EMACS is a slightly more familiar-looking text editor that is valued for its extensibility. It is extremely configurable with a lot of tools and packages available. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in EMACS, type `emacs filename`. Unlike in VIM, you will immediately be able to write in/edit thew file. Once you are finished editing, you type `ctrl+x` followed by `ctrl+c` to save and exit. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to save and quit. Typing `y` and then enter will return you to the terminal."
