    "The shell is a basic interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel and any installed programs. When most people interact with computers, they do so through graphical user interfaces that they navigate using a mouse or their finger. The shell is completely text-based and designed for programmers. It has its own programming language of special commands to access kernel functionalities. \n",
