    "UNIX has instilled in generations of computer scientists a basic aesthetic for how to design and structure complicated collections of software.  In particular one learns that the designers of UNIX tried to structure the system around a small core set of ideas, \"abstractions\", that once understood allows a programmer to understand the rest of the system and how to get things done.   In this chapter we briefly introduce some of those key abstractions, with the focus being: 1) to provide a conceptual overview, 2) provide enough information to get you started on writing a simple shell; the introductory assignment in many OS courses.  \n",

This central idea enables one to write programs that do the same task irrespective of where the data is coming from or going to.  As we will see, it also allows programmers to tie together multiple simple programs to do a more complex task.  \n"

Entries are added to the table by operations that open or create a file or create a special file like a network connection.  There are three special file descriptors shown in {numref}`fd-table`, that programs (and libraries) should use for input, output and errors. \n",

So, lets say we are trying to find all the programs on our computer that have anything to do with perl, the following command will list the contents of the /usr/bin/ directory send the output of that listing to a grep program that searches for the word perl, and send the output of that to a program that counts the number of lines of input it had\n"
