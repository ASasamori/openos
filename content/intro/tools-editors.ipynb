    "The vast majority of OS developers use text based editors, and in particular [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and [EMACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs), which are both available in the container image made available with this book. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of which editor you use, for many OS developers, a religion.  They have very different paradigms, vim is a relatively simple editor that is easy to get started with, while emacs takes more time to master, but is enormously more powerful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With vim, you use it just to modify files, and then exit vim when you want to compile, debug or run your programs. For Vim, to open a file, type `vim <filename>`. When you enter vim, you will automatically be in `normal mode` where you can navigate using your cursor. To insert text, type `i` to enter `insert mode`. or 'a' to enter 'append mode'. when you are done changes, press the `esc` key to enter normal mode, next press `:` to enter `command mode`, lastly press `w` and enter to save. To quit, enter command mode and enter `q`.\n",

    "While you could use emacs in a similar fashion, just to edit files, power users live in emacs and use to to compile, debug, and run their programs; providing enormous power to expert developers.  To open a file in EMACS, type `emacs <filename>`. Unlike in VIM, you will immediately be able to write in/edit thew file. Once you are finished editing, you type `ctrl+x` followed by `ctrl+c` to save and exit. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to save and quit. Typing `y` and then enter will return you to the terminal.  To master emacs, you can \n",
