    "\n",
    "The purpose of an operating system is to provide everything needed to enable applications to run on computers.  We [first](cont:gs:purpose:hw) present a simple model of hardware and why the OS is needed, then discuss how this has resulted in operating systems becoming the [fundamental platform](cont:gs:purpose:platform) that all computing depends on, and finally discuss why, as operating system researchers and developers, feel like the [fun has just started](cont:gs:purpose:care). Our hope is that at the end of this chapter you will not only realize why it is so important for all computer scientists and engineers to have a fundamental understanding of operating systems, but to also to realize why so many people are excited to work on and contribute to operating systems.  Consider that today's dominant operating systems are open source, and rely on 1000s of contributors from all over the world, many who volunteer their time.\n",
