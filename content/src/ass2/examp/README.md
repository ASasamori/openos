Some simple programs to demonstrate set and longjump and what how in the second assignment you can set and get registers
   - jmp1 - example program using set/long jump
   - jmp2 - extracting pc - look at disassembly
   - jmp3 - de-mangled pointer
   - jmp4 - using de-mangled pointer 

To look at the calling code convetion, a little tutorial on gdb
   - debug calling_code
     - disass
     - info regis
     - info regis rip
     - info regis rsp
     - x/10gx <address>
