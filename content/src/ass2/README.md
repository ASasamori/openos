# Debugging forked programs

Some simple programs to demonstrate set and longjump and what how in the second assignment you can find the PC...
   - jmp1 - example program using set/long jump
   - jmp2 - extracting pc - look at disassembly
   - jmp3 - de-mangled pointer
   - jmp4 - using de-mangled pointer
   - sched_simple: a toy round robin scheduler; starts each c program from start; how would you change it.
