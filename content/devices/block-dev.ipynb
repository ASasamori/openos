    "Input/Output (I/O) devices are crucial to the operation of a computer.\n",
    "The data that a program processes --- as well as the program binary\n",

    "disk, network, or keyboard. Similarly, without a way to output the\n",
    "results of a computation to the user or to storage, those results would\n",
    "be lost. One of the primary functions of the operating system is to\n",
    "manage these I/O devices. It should control access to them, as well as\n",

    "Intel-architecture computer from a few years ago. Different parts of the\n",
    "system are connected by buses, or communication channels, operating at\n",
    "various speeds. The Front-Side Bus carries all memory transactions which\n",

    "to memory (DDR2 bus) or I/O devices (PCIe bus) based on their address.\n",
    "The PCI Express (PCIe) is somewhat slower than the front-side bus, but\n",
    "can be extended farther; it connects all the I/O devices on the system.\n",
    "In some cases (like USB and SATA), a controller connected to the PCIe\n",

    "addresses with DIP switches.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"bus\" was taken from electrical engineering; in high-power\n",

    "\n",
    "A device typically requires multiple parameters to perform an operation\n",

    "controller, for instance, these parameters would include the type of\n",
    "access (read or write), the disk locations to be accessed, and the\n",
    "memory address where data will be stored or retrieved from. Rather than\n",
    "writing each of these parameters individually to device registers, the\n",
    "parameters are typically combined in memory in what is called a *DMA\n",

    "efficient than multiple programmed I/O writes, this approach also allows\n",
    "multiple requests to be queued for a device. (In the case of queued disk\n",

    "### Primary Disk Scheduling Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary algorithms used for disk scheduling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first-come first-served (FCFS):** in other words no scheduling, with\n",
    "requests handled in the order that they are received.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortest seek time first (SSTF):** this is the throughput-optimal\n",
    "strategy; however it is prone to starvation, as a stream of requests to\n",
    "nearby sections of the disk can prevent another request from being\n",
    "serviced for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SCAN:** this (and variants) are what is termed the *elevator\n",
    "algorithm* --- pending requests are served from the inside to the\n",
    "outside of the disk, then from the outside back in, etc., much like an\n",
    "elevator goes from the first floor to the highest requested one before\n",
    "going back down again. It is nearly as efficient as SSTF, while avoiding\n",
    "starvation. (With SSTF one process can keep sending requests which will\n",
    "require less seek time than another waiting request, \"starving\" the\n",
    "waiting one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated disk head scheduling algorithms exist, and could no\n",
    "doubt be found by a scan of the patent literature; however they are\n",
    "mostly of interest to hard drive designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Disk Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk scheduling can be implemented in two ways --- in the operating\n",
    "system, or in the device itself. OS-level scheduling is performed by\n",
    "keeping a queue of requests which can be re-ordered before they are sent\n",
    "to the disk. On-disk scheduling requires the ability to send multiple\n",
    "commands to the disk before the first one completes, so that the disk is\n",
    "given a choice of which to complete first. This is supported as Command\n",
    "Queuing in SCSI, and in SATA as Native Command Queuing (NCQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that OS-level I/O scheduling is of limited use today for improving\n",
    "overall disk performance, as the OS has little or no visibility into the\n",
    "internal geometry of a drive. (OS scheduling is still used to merge\n",
    "adjacent requests into larger ones and to allocate performance fairly to\n",
    "different processes, however.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Disk Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to scheduling, the other strategy used to improve disk\n",
    "performance is caching, which takes two forms---*read caching* (also\n",
    "called track buffering) and *write buffering*. Disk drives typically\n",
    "have a small amount of RAM used for caching data [^3]. Although this is\n",
    "very small in comparison the the amount of RAM typically dedicated to\n",
    "caching on the host, if used properly it can make a significant\n",
    "difference in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "At read time, after seeking to a track it is common practice for the\n",
    "disk to store the entire track in the on-disk cache, in case the host\n",
    "requests this data in the near future. Consider, for example, the case\n",
    "when the host requests sector 10 on a track, then almost (but not quite)\n",
    "immediately requests sector 11. Without the track buffer it would have\n",
    "missed the chance to read 11, and would have to wait an entire\n",
    "revolution for it to come back around; with the track buffer, small\n",
    "sequential requests such as this can be handled efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write buffering is a different matter entirely, and refers to a feature\n",
    "where a disk drive may acknowledge a write request while the data is\n",
    "still in RAM, before it has been written to disk. This can risk loss of\n",
    "data, as there is a period of time during which the application thinks\n",
    "that data has been safely written, while it would in fact be lost if\n",
    "power failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in theory most or all of the performance benefit of write\n",
    "buffering could be achieved in a safer fashion via proper use of command\n",
    "queuing, this feature was not available (or poorly implemented) in\n",
    "consumer drives until recently; as a result write buffering is enabled\n",
    "in SATA drives by default. Although write buffering can be disabled on a\n",
    "per-drive basis, modern file systems typically issue commands[^4] to\n",
    "flush the cache when necessary to ensure file system data is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SATA and SCSI\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all disk drives today use one of two interfaces: SATA (or its\n",
    "precursor, IDE) or SCSI. The SATA and IDE interfaces are derived from an\n",
    "ancient disk controller for the PC, the ST-506, introduced in about\n",
    "1980. This controller was similar to---but even cruder than---the disk\n",
    "interface in our fictional computer, with registers for the command to\n",
    "execute (read/write/other) and address (cylinder/head/sector), and a\n",
    "single register which the CPU read from or wrote to repeatedly to\n",
    "transfer data. What is called the ATA (AT bus-attached) or IDE\n",
    "(integrated drive electronics) disk was created by putting this\n",
    "controller on the drive itself, and using an extender cable to connect\n",
    "it back to the bus, so that the same software could still access the\n",
    "control registers. Over the years many extensions were made, including\n",
    "DMA support, logical block addressing, and a high-speed serial\n",
    "connection instead of a multi-wire cable; however the protocol is still\n",
    "based on the idea of the CPU writing to and reading from a set of\n",
    "remote, disk-resident registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: gbar\n",
    "**Logical vs. CHS addressing:** For CHS addressing to work the OS (and\n",

    "(1,1,52) or (2,1,0). For large computers sold with a small selection of\n",
    "vendor-approved disks this was not a problem, but it was a major hassle\n",
    "with PCs---you had to read a label on the disk and set BIOS options.\n",
    "Then drive manufacturers started using \"fake\" geometries because there\n",
    "weren't enough bits in the cylinder and sector fields, making drives\n",

    "Packet-based. The initiator (i.e. host) sends a command packet (e.g.\n",
    "READ or WRITE) over the bus to the target; DATA packets are then sent in\n",
    "the appropriate direction followed by a status indication. SCSI\n",
    "specifies these packets over the bus; how the CPU interacts with the\n",

    "\n",
    "### Storage-area Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In enterprise environments it is typical to separate storage systems\n",
    "from the servers that use the storage. This allows tasks such as backup\n",
    "to be centralized, as well as simplifying the task of replacing or\n",
    "servicing hardware. (In fact, in a virtualized environment (covered in a\n",
    "later chapter) external storage allows running servers to be moved from\n",
    "one piece of hardware to another without interruption.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage-Area Networks, or SANs, typically use the SCSI protocol and a\n",
    "transport which can be routed or switched as a network. The most common\n",
    "SAN technologies are Fibre Channel and iSCSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "::: itemize*\n",
    "Fibre Channel is a bizarre networking protocol used only in SANs; for\n",
    "historic reasons it is typically used with optical fiber cabling, which\n",
    "is expensive and unreliable for short connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "iSCSI is an encapsulation of SCSI within TCP/IP; it uses traditional\n",
    "ethernet cabling, switching, and IP routing, although an iSCSI\n",
    "deployment may use a separate network for storage.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Disks\" on a SAN are identified by a transport address (either an IP\n",
    "address or DNS name, for iSCSI, or a 64-bit World Wide Name (WWN) for\n",
    "Fibre Channel) plus a logical unit number (LUN), which identifies a\n",
    "specific volume on a target. In other words, an individual block of data\n",
    "on a SAN can be identified by address + LUN + LBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key administrative features in a SAN is LUN masking, which\n",
    "determines which resources (LUNs) on the network may be seen by which\n",
    "hosts. This lets each server see only the LUNs which have been assigned\n",
    "to it, so that a misconfigured host cannot access or corrupt storage\n",
    "which it is not supposed to have access to. In addition to source-based\n",
    "access control, iSCSI also offers several authentication protocols, to\n",
    "prevent access to disk volumes from unauthorized hosts or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### De-duplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Large enterprise storage systems typically store large amounts of\n",
    "similar data. As an example, your CCIS account stores your home\n",
    "directory on a central server; if you log onto a college Windows or\n",
    "Linux machine almost all the files you create and edit will be located\n",
    "on this server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a corporate environment this approach is frequently used with desktop\n",
    "machines, resulting in many copies of the same data (items like a\n",
    "spreadsheet or document sent to several people will be copied into each\n",
    "users' email inbox) In addition in such environments data is backed up\n",
    "frequently, creating even more copies. Very high compression ratios can\n",
    "be achieved by saving only a single copy of such data, using a process\n",
    "called (not surprisingly) *deduplication*. We see this in the figure\n",
    "below, where the data to be stored is 26 long, but only contains 9\n",
    "unique blocks, giving a nearly 3:1 compression ratio if the 26 blocks of\n",
    "data are replaced by pointers to unique data blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "![De-duplication](../images/pb-figures/devs/dedup.png){width=\"80%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform deduplication, a cryptographic hash (a form of checksum) is\n",
    "calculated over each block to be written, and checked against a\n",
    "database. If the hash is found, then a block containing the same bits\n",
    "has already been written to storage, and we store a pointer to that\n",
    "block. If not---i.e. it is the first time we saw that particular data\n",
    "pattern---it is written to a new location on disk, and a pointer to that\n",
    "location is stored. By using this map we can then (somewhat slowly)\n",
    "retrieve the data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "De-duplication is widely used for storing backups and retaining data for\n",
    "legal purposes, as it achieves very high compression (and thus lower\n",
    "cost) in many such cases. However, due to the overhead and\n",
    "non-sequential reads involved in retrieving data, it is typically much\n",
    "slower than normal storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `ls` example the block layer and disk drive get used extensively\n",
    "by the file system. When the new process is created the kernel must read\n",
    "the first page from disk, to identify the type of executable, and then\n",
    "after the sections are mapped into memory, page faults will cause block\n",
    "read requests to be sent through the file system to the underlying\n",
    "device. Additional disk requests will come in response to the `readdir`\n",
    "system call, as the file system reads directory and inode data to list\n",
    "the files in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll ignore the file system for now, as it is described in more detail\n",
    "in later chapters, and focus on the role of the Linux block layer, which\n",
    "sits between file systems and the physical devices[^8]. The block layer\n",
    "is organized around the `struct bio` object, a typical Linux kernel\n",
    "object which is fantastically complicated in order to track lots of\n",
    "things we don't really care about. We'll ignore most of this complexity;\n",
    "the fields that we're concerned with are the command flag (indicating\n",
    "read or write), data pointer (points to one or more pages), a callback\n",
    "function and private data field provided by the subsystem which\n",
    "submitted the I/O (more on this below), and a pointer to the device to\n",
    "which the I/O has been issued. (actually a pointer to a\n",
    "`struct block_device`)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a note about the private data pointer and callbacks, which are a\n",
    "common design pattern in C. (at least in the Linux kernel) In a proper\n",
    "object-oriented language, if you want to specialize a class (e.g. a\n",
    "block I/O descriptor) by adding additional fields (e.g. for details like\n",
    "timers or queues needed by your device driver), you can create a derived\n",
    "class with these additional fields. You can't do that in C---you can\n",
    "allocate two structures, or embed an instance of the general structure\n",
    "within the specialized one, but there will be cases (like callback\n",
    "functions) where a function handling the general class will in turn\n",
    "invoke another function which needs to access the specialized structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to do this is via a \"private data\" field in\n",
    "a object; this is a generic pointer which is set to point to a separate\n",
    "structure holding the specialized data. An example shown in the listing\n",
    "below is the bio callback function (called `bi_end_io`): this is a\n",
    "function pointer which is invoked when the I/O operation completes,\n",
    "which is given a pointer to the bio itself as an argument.\n",
