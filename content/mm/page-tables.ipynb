    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ways to structure a page table for mapping 20-bit\n",
    "page numbers is as a simple array with $2^{20}$ entries. With this\n",
    "configuration, each virtual page has an entry, and the value in that\n",
    "entry is the corresponding physical page number, as seen in\n",
    "[\\[fig:vm:fig11\\]](#fig:vm:fig11){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:vm:fig11\"}. This single-level table is located in\n",
    "physical memory, and the MMU is given a pointer to this table, which is\n",
    "stored in an MMU register. (On Intel-compatible CPUs, the page table\n",
    "pointer is Control Register 3, or CR3.) This is shown in\n",
    "[\\[fig:vm:fig11\\]](#fig:vm:fig11){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:vm:fig11\"}, where we see the first two entries in a\n",
    "$2^{20}$ or 1048576-entry mapping table. In addition to the translated\n",
    "page number, each entry contains a *P* bit to indicate whether or not\n",
    "the entry is \"present,\" i.e., valid. Unlike in C or Java we can't use a\n",
    "special null pointer, because 0 is a perfectly valid page number[^3].\n",

    "The single-level page table handles the problem of encoding the\n",

    "less. Even today, it remains problematic. As an example, when these\n",
    "notes were first written (2013), the most heavily-used machine in the\n",
    "CCIS lab (login.ccs.neu.edu) had 4 GB of memory, and when I checked it\n",
    "had 640 running processes. With 4 MB page tables and one table per\n",
    "process, this would require 2.5GB of memory just for page tables, or\n",
    "most of the machine's memory. Worse yet, each table would require a\n",
    "contiguous 4MB region of memory, running into the same problem of\n",
    "external fragmentation that paged address translation was supposed to\n",
    "solve."
