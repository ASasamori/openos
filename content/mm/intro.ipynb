    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To paraphrase [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) programs expand to fill the memory available to hold them, and home computers have millions times more memory than they had when Larry was young.  As discussed in the overall introduction memory is fast but small and expensive compared to storage, but it is volatile, all changes are lost after a reboot.  Memory management is the part of the operating system that provides a useful virtual memory interface and that allocates, frees and tracks the usage of the actual physical memory or RAM.  It manages a virtual address space for each process it manages and all the physical memory of the system, making it available to different processes through virtual memory depending on their demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most computers support paged virtual memory, but before we get into that, we motivate today's memory management by discussing systems without any virtual memory and with segmented virtual memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Memory/No Virtual Memory\n",
    "On a system without virtual memory there is one physical address space and programs are loaded into physical memory, allocate physical memory as needed and directly access those physical memory locations or addresses.  If more than one program is running at the same time they are simply loaded into a different physical address and allocate different physical addresses.  This means every program must either know the physical address that it is running or it must be relocated when it is loaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Memory\n",
    "What is most desirable and usable is a virtual memory model where every program would run in a process that has a unique but identical virtual address space.  A virtual address space would ideally start at address zero and extend up to some very large address.  Since every process appears to have the same virtual address space programs can be loaded at the same virtual address and therefore do not need to to be relocated.  There are 2 basic virtual memory models: Segmented Virtual Memory and Paged Virtual Memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmented Virtual Memory\n",
    "A simple segmented virtual address space starts at location zero and extend up to some upper limit. Its implemented in hardware using base and offset registers.  Every memory reference is virtual and is translated to a physical address in hardware by adding the base register to the virtual address and qualified by insuring the result is less than the offset register.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paged Virtual Memory\n",
    "A paged virtual memory model splits both the virtual address space and physical memory into fixed size pieces knows as virtual pages and physical page frames respectively.  The mapping of virtual pages to physical page frames is accomplished via an array of page frame numbers known as a page table.  There is one page table entry for each virtual page and only then pages that are being used contain valid page table entries and therefore map physical page frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paged virtual memory aka paging introduces the possibility of several additional highly desirable features to the memory management system but also introduces several additional challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Several huge virtual address spaces can be much larger than physical memory via over-committing physical memory.\n",
    " - Total isolation of each virtual address space from all others.\n",
    " - Sharing of selective regions of memory between different virtual address spaces is easy.\n",
    " - Use of memory pages to cache file system data and meta-data is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Very large and sparse virtual address space requires page fault logic that maps physical memory on-demand.\n",
    " - Over-committing physical memory requires sophisticated page reclaim logic.\n",
    " - Supporting multiple page sizes on different architectures complicates an already complex memory management system.\n",
    " - Very large virtual address space requires large and complex multi-level page table design.\n",
