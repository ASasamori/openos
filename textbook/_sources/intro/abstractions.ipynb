    "This probably seems obvious to a modern reader, i.e., an object oriented design, where you can do the same operations on any object. However, at the time, it was a radical idea, operating systems had specialized interfaces for files with records, terminals, etcâ€¦  Moreover, by introducing the idea of a special object/file, a *pipe*, you could allow programs to be combined together to do much more powerful tasks.   The **|** symbol tells the shell to create a pipe that connects the output of one program to the input of the next program.  So, lets say we are trying to find all the programs on our computer that have anything to do with perl, the following command will list the contents of the /usr/bin/ directory send the output of that listing to a grep program that searches for the word perl, and send the output of that to a program that counts the number of lines of input it had"
