    "\n",
    "The purpose of an operating system is to provide everything needed to enable applications to run on computers.  We [first](cont:gs:purpose:hw) present a simple model of hardware and why the OS is needed, then discuss how this has resulted in operating systems becoming the [fundamental platform](cont:gs:purpose:platform) that all computing depends on, and finally discuss why we, as operating system researchers and developers, feel like the [fun has just started](cont:gs:purpose:care). Our hope is that at the end of this chapter you will not only realize why it is so important for all computer scientists and engineers to have a fundamental understanding of operating systems, but to also to realize why so many people are excited to work on and contribute to operating systems.  Consider that today's dominant operating systems are open source, and rely on 1000s of contributors from all over the world, many who volunteer their time.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**:  The smart part that executes instructions is called the Central Processing Unit (CPU) or **processor**.  In our simple model, these instructions operate by modifying the contents of various processor registers, and loading new register contents from memory, and storing registers into memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory:** Also referred to as **Random Access Memory (RAM)**, holds the instructions and data that running applications require.  It is physically connected to the CPU via direct wiring.  Random access here refers to the fact that the processor can directly load or store any memory location (addressed as an 8-bit byte) in the same amount of time.   Memory today is normally volatile, where the contents are lost when the computer is powered off. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **I/O bus:** If the computer wasn't connected to anything, you couldn't do much with it.  All computers have some form of Input/Output (or I/O) bus that connects them to different devices.  While there are many kinds of I/O devices, for now we will ignore everything but: 1) storage, and 2) networks.   The processor normally talks to an I/O device by, typically, loading and storing registers on a controller specific to the device, and that controller in turn communicates with the corresponding device(s) and transfers data between the device and memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage:** Since the memory is typically volatile, computers have to have some form of storage that are non-volatile.  This may include hard drives, SSDs, optimical drives, usb sticks, etc.  Most storage devices are accessed at a block granularity (e.g., 512 or 4096 bytes), and where entire blocks are transferred between storage and memory. Most storage devices are not **Random Access**, for example, technologies like a hard disk drive require the disk head to physically move to the location on the disk before reading or writing the data.  When the processor wants to read or write a block of disk, it tells the storage controller the block of disk to transfer to or from memory, and the storage controller notifies the processor when the operation is complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Networking:** To talk to the outside world computers are normally connected to some network, typically today ethernet, where information is transferred between memory and the network in some form of packet as shown in {numref}`ethernet-packet`.  When the processor wants to send a message over the network, it is prepared in memory, and then tells the network controller to send it.  When new packets arrive over the network, the controller copies them into memory, and then tells the processor (in some fashion) that a new packet is available to be processed. \n",

That enables, for example, Netflix runs to on my mac, ipad, and tesla.  The operating system provides a common set of abstractions so that application programmers don't have to re-written everything when moving from one system to another.

In a cell phone, the OS needs to ensure that everything works in a tiny amount of memory, with limited energy use while HPC systems today can have 4TBytes of memory that needs to be efficiently managed.
