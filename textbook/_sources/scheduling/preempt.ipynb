    "We allot a bounded amount of time for a process to run in a given turn and this bounded time is called a *time slice*. In *batch scheduling*, this time slice is the entire time needed to execute the job, while in *preemptive scheduling* the time slice is typically much shorter than the time to run a process to completion (though not necessarily static, as we will see).
