    "One of the key responsibilities of an operating system is that of synchronization---handling concurrent events in a reasonable way, and providing mechanisms for user applications to do so as well.  Synchronization occurs for multi-threaded applications and when processes share memory.  We [first](cont:sync:sharing) discuss mechanisms in unix to share memory and provide simple motivating examples for synchronization.  We then discuss the idea of a [critical section and locking](cont:sync:criticalsection), and [then](cont:sync:locks) review different implementations of locks.  The following [chapter](cont:sync:ordering) discusses some of the challenges of ordering thread events and introduces a key OS primitive, semaphores, to enable thread to block rather than spin.  We then discuss common [concurrency bugs](cont:sync:concurrency_bugs) and introduce the concept of deadlock, where no progress is made. Many data structures are read-mostly, and the following chapter [discusses](cont:sync:readmostly) synchronization primitives optimized for accessing these data structures. We then discuss some of the challenges introduced by [modern hardware](cont:sync:hardware_challenge), and synchronization in the [Linux kernel](cont:sync:linux_locking). \n"
