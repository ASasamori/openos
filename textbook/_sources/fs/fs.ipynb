    "## File System Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common types of file operations supported by Linux\n",
    "(and with slight differences, Windows). They can be classified into\n",
    "three main categories: open/close, read/write, and naming and\n",
    "directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open/close**: In order to access a file in Linux (or most operating\n",
    "systems) you first need to open the file, passing the file name and\n",
    "other parameters and receiving a *handle* (called a *file descriptor* in\n",
    "Unix) which may be used for further operations. The corresponding system\n",
    "calls are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int desc = open(name, O_READ)` - Verify that file `name` exists and may\n",
    "be read, and then return a *descriptor* which may be used to refer to\n",
    "that file when reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int desc = open(name, O_WRITE | flags, mode)` - Verify permissions and\n",
    "open `name` for writing, creating it (or erasing existing contents) if\n",
    "necessary as specified in `flags`. Returns a descriptor which may be\n",
    "used for writing to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `close(desc)` - stop using this descriptor, and free any resources\n",
    "allocated for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that application programs rarely use the system calls themselves to\n",
    "access files, but instead use higher-level frameworks, ranging from Unix\n",
    "Standard I/O to high-level application frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read/Write operations**: To get a file with data in it, you need to\n",
    "write it; to use that data you need to read it. To allow reading and\n",
    "writing in units of less than an entire file, or tedius calculations of\n",
    "the current file offset, UNIX uses the concept of a *current position*\n",
    "associated with a file descriptor. When you read 100 bytes (i.e. bytes 0\n",
    "to 99) from a file this pointer advances by 100 bytes, so that the next\n",
    "read will start at byte 100, and similarly for write. When a file is\n",
    "opened for reading the pointer starts at 0; when open for writing the\n",
    "application writer can choose to start at the beginning (default) and\n",
    "overwrite old data, or start at the end (`O_APPEND` flag) to append new\n",
    "data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "System calls for reading and writing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n = read(desc, buffer, max)` - Read `max` bytes (or fewer if the end of\n",
    "the file is reached) into `buffer`, starting at the current position,\n",
    "and returning the actual number of bytes `n` read; the current position\n",
    "is then incremented by `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n = write(desc, buffer, len)` - write `len` bytes from `buffer` into\n",
    "the file, starting at the current position, and incrementing the current\n",
    "position by `len`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lseek(desc, offset, flag)` Set an open file's current position to that\n",
    "specified by `offset` and `flag`, which specifies whether `offset` is\n",
    "relative to the beginning, end, or current position in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the basic Unix interface (unlike e.g. Windows) there is no\n",
    "way to specify a particular location in a file to read or write\n",
    "from[^3]. Programs like databases (e.g. SQLite, MySQL) which need to\n",
    "write to and read from arbitrary file locations must instead move the\n",
    "current position by using `lseek` before a read or write. However most\n",
    "programs either read or write a file from the beginning to the end\n",
    "(especially when written for an OS that makes it easier to do things\n",
    "that way), and thus don't really need to perform seeks. Because most\n",
    "Unix programs use simple \"stream\" input and output, these may be\n",
    "re-directed so that the same program can---without any special\n",
    "programming---read from or write to a terminal, a network connection, a\n",
    "file, or a pipe from or to another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming and Directories**: In Unix there is a difference between a name\n",
    "(a directory entry) and the object (file or directory) that the name\n",
    "points to. The naming and directories operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rename(path1, path2)` - Rename an object (i.e. file or directory) by\n",
    "either changing the name in its directory entry (if the destination is\n",
    "in the same directory) or creating a new entry and deleting the old one\n",
    "(if moving into a new directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `link(path1, path2)` Add a *hard link* to a file[^4].\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unlink(path)` - Delete a file.[^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `desc = opendir(path)`\\\n",
    "`readdir(desc, dirent*), dirent=(name,type,length)` This interface\n",
    "allows a program to enumerate names in a directory, and determine their\n",
    "type. (i.e. file, directory, symbolic link, or special-purpose file)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stat(file, statbuf)`\\\n",
    "`fstat(desc, statbuf)` - returns file attributes - size, owner,\n",
    "permissions, modification time, etc. In Unix these are attributes of the\n",
    "file itself, residing in the i-node, and can't be found in the directory\n",
    "entry - otherwise it would be necessary to keep multiple copies\n",
    "consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mkdir(path)`\\\n",

    "would be on one file system (e.g. \"disk1\"), while \"/home/pjd/file.txt\"\n",

    "The actual implementation of mounting in Linux and other Unix-like\n",

    "mapping directories to directories on other file systems. In the example\n",
    "above, one entry would map \"/home\" on disk1 to (\"disk2\", \"/\"). As the\n",
    "kernel translates a pathname it checks each directory in this table; if\n",
    "found, it substitutes the mapped file system and directory before\n",

    "## Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk accesses are slow, and multiple disk accesses are even slower. If\n",
    "every file operation required multiple disk accesses, your computer\n",
    "would run very slowly. Instead much of the information from the disk is\n",
    "cached in memory in various ways so that it can be used multiple times\n",
    "without going back to disk. Some of these ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**File descriptors:** When an application opens a file the OS must\n",
    "translate the path to find the file's inode; the inode number and\n",
    "information from that inode can then be saved in a data structure\n",
    "associated with that open file (a *file descriptor* in Unix, or *file\n",
    "handle* in Windows), and freed when the file descriptor is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation caching:** An OS will typically maintain an in-memory\n",
    "translation cache (the dentry cache in Linux, holding individual\n",
    "directory entries) which holds frequently-used translations, such as\n",
    "root directory entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory entry cache differs from e.g. a CPU cache in that it holds\n",
    "both normal entries (e.g. directory+name to inode) and negative entries,\n",
    "indicating that directory+name does not exist[^15]. If no entry is found\n",
    "the directory is searched, and the results added to the dentry cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block caching:** To accelerate reads of frequently-accessed blocks,\n",
    "rather than directly reading from the disk the OS can maintain a *block\n",
    "cache*. Before going to disk the OS checks to see whether a copy of the\n",
    "disk block is already present; if so the data can be copied directly,\n",
    "and if not it is read from disk and inserted into the cache before being\n",
    "returned. When data is modified it can be written to this cache and\n",
    "written back later to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, this allows small reads (smaller than a disk block)\n",
    "and small writes to be more efficient. The first small read will cause\n",
    "the block to be read into cache, while following reads from the same\n",
    "block will come from cache. Small writes will modify the same block in\n",
    "cache, and if a block is not flushed immediately to disk, it can be\n",
    "modified multiple times while only resulting in a single write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern OSes like Linux use a combined buffer cache, where virtual memory\n",
    "pages and the file system cache come from the same pool. It's a bit\n",
    "complicated, and is not covered in this class."
