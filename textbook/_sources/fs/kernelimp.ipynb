    "\n",
    "Disk accesses are slow, and multiple disk accesses are even slower. If\n",
    "every file operation required multiple disk accesses, your computer\n",
    "would run very slowly. Instead much of the information from the disk is\n",
    "cached in memory in various ways so that it can be used multiple times\n",
    "without going back to disk. Some of these ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**File descriptors:** When an application opens a file the OS must\n",
    "translate the path to find the file's inode; the inode number and\n",
    "information from that inode can then be saved in a data structure\n",
    "associated with that open file (a *file descriptor* in Unix, or *file\n",
    "handle* in Windows), and freed when the file descriptor is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation caching:** An OS will typically maintain an in-memory\n",
    "translation cache (the dentry cache in Linux, holding individual\n",
    "directory entries) which holds frequently-used translations, such as\n",
    "root directory entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory entry cache differs from e.g. a CPU cache in that it holds\n",
    "both normal entries (e.g. directory+name to inode) and negative entries,\n",
    "indicating that directory+name does not exist[^15]. If no entry is found\n",
    "the directory is searched, and the results added to the dentry cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block caching:** To accelerate reads of frequently-accessed blocks,\n",
    "rather than directly reading from the disk the OS can maintain a *block\n",
    "cache*. Before going to disk the OS checks to see whether a copy of the\n",
    "disk block is already present; if so the data can be copied directly,\n",
    "and if not it is read from disk and inserted into the cache before being\n",
    "returned. When data is modified it can be written to this cache and\n",
    "written back later to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, this allows small reads (smaller than a disk block)\n",
    "and small writes to be more efficient. The first small read will cause\n",
    "the block to be read into cache, while following reads from the same\n",
    "block will come from cache. Small writes will modify the same block in\n",
    "cache, and if a block is not flushed immediately to disk, it can be\n",
    "modified multiple times while only resulting in a single write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern OSes like Linux use a combined buffer cache, where virtual memory\n",
    "pages and the file system cache come from the same pool. It's a bit\n",
    "complicated, and is not covered in this class."
