The assignment to $\b$0\b0 sets the name of\r\n                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.\r\n       -\b-i\bi        If the -\b-i\bi option is present, the shell is _\bi_\bn_\bt_\be_\br_\ba_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bv_\be.\r\n       -\b-l\bl        Make b\bba\bas\bsh\bh act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see\r\n                 I\bIN\bNV\bVO\bOC\bCA\bAT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN below).\r\n       -\b-r\br        If the -\b-r\br option is present,  the  shell  becomes  _\br_\be_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bc_\bt_\be_\bd\r\n                 (see R\bRE\bES\bST\bTR\bRI\bIC\bCT\bTE\bED\bD S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL below).\r\n       -\b-s\bs        If  the -\b-s\bs option is present, or if no arguments remain after\r\n                 option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard\r\n                 input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be\r\n                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading  input\r\n                 through a pipe.\r\n       -\b-D\bD        A  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $\b$ is printed\r\n                 on the standard output.

If\r\n                 _\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\b__\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn is present, -\b-O\bO sets the value of that option; +\b+O\bO\r\n                 unsets it.  If _\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\b__\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn is not supplied,  the  names  and\r\n                 values  of the shell options accepted by s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt are printed on\r\n                 the standard output.  If the invocation  option  is  +\b+O\bO,  the\r\n                 output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.\r\n       -\b--\b-        A  -\b--\b-  signals the end of options and disables further option\r\n                 processing.

If b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is invoked  in  this\r\n       fashion,  $\b$0\b0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parame\u2010\r\n       ters are set to the remaining arguments.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh reads and executes  com\u2010\r\n       mands  from this file, then exits.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh's exit status is the exit sta\u2010\r\n       tus of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are ex\u2010\r\n       ecuted,  the  exit  status  is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the\r\n       file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell\r\n       searches the directories in P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH for the script.\r\n\r\nI\bIN\bNV\bVO\bOC\bCA\bAT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       A  _\bl_\bo_\bg_\bi_\bn _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl is one whose first character of argument zero is a -\b-, or\r\n       one started with the -\b--\b-l\blo\bog\bgi\bin\bn option.\r\n\r\n       An _\bi_\bn_\bt_\be_\br_\ba_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bv_\be shell is one started without non-option  arguments  (un\u2010\r\n       less  -\b-s\bs  is  specified) and without the -\b-c\bc option whose standard input\r\n       and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by _\bi_\bs_\ba_\bt_\bt_\by(3)),\r\n       or  one  started  with  the -\b-i\bi option.  P\bPS\bS1\b1 is set and $\b$-\b- includes i\bi if\r\n       b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to  test\r\n       this state.\r\n\r\n       The  following paragraphs describe how b\bba\bas\bsh\bh executes its startup files.\r\n       If any of the files exist but cannot be read, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  reports  an  error.\r\n       Tildes  are expanded in filenames as described below under T\bTi\bil\bld\bde\be E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bn\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       s\bsi\bio\bon\bn in the E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN section.\r\n\r\n       When b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-inter\u2010\r\n       active  shell with the -\b--\b-l\blo\bog\bgi\bin\bn option, it first reads and executes com\u2010\r\n       mands from the file _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bp_\br_\bo_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be, if that file exists.   After  reading\r\n       that file, it looks for _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\b__\bp_\br_\bo_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be, _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\b__\bl_\bo_\bg_\bi_\bn, and _\b~_\b/_\b._\bp_\br_\bo_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be,\r\n       in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one  that\r\n       exists  and  is  readable.  The -\b--\b-n\bno\bop\bpr\bro\bof\bfi\bil\ble\be option may be used when the\r\n       shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\n       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell\r\n       executes  the  e\bex\bxi\bit\bt  builtin  command, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh reads and executes commands\r\n       from the file _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\b__\bl_\bo_\bg_\bo_\bu_\bt, if it exists.\r\n\r\n       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh\r\n       reads  and executes commands from _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\br_\bc, if that file exists.  This\r\n       may be inhibited by using the -\b--\b-n\bno\bor\brc\bc option.  The -\b--\b-r\brc\bcf\bfi\bil\ble\be _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be  option\r\n       will  force  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  to  read  and  execute commands from _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be instead of\r\n       _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\br_\bc.\r\n\r\n       When b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for  ex\u2010\r\n       ample,  it  looks for the variable B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_E\bEN\bNV\bV in the environment, expands\r\n       its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the  name\r\n       of  a  file to read and execute.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh behaves as if the following com\u2010\r\n       mand were executed:\r\n              if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\r\n       but the value of the P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH variable is not used to search for the  file\u2010\r\n       name.\r\n\r\n       If  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is invoked with the name s\bsh\bh, it tries to mimic the startup be\u2010\r\n       havior of historical versions of s\bsh\bh as closely as possible, while  con\u2010\r\n       forming  to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive\r\n       login shell, or a non-interactive shell with  the  -\b--\b-l\blo\bog\bgi\bin\bn  option,  it\r\n       first  attempts  to  read  and  execute  commands from _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bp_\br_\bo_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be and\r\n       _\b~_\b/_\b._\bp_\br_\bo_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be, in that order.  The -\b--\b-n\bno\bop\bpr\bro\bof\bfi\bil\ble\be option may be used  to  in\u2010\r\n       hibit  this  behavior.   When  invoked as an interactive shell with the\r\n       name s\bsh\bh, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh looks for the variable E\bEN\bNV\bV, expands its value  if  it  is\r\n       defined,  and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and\r\n       execute.  Since a shell invoked as s\bsh\bh does not attempt to read and exe\u2010\r\n       cute  commands from any other startup files, the -\b--\b-r\brc\bcf\bfi\bil\ble\be option has no\r\n       effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name s\bsh\bh does not  at\u2010\r\n       tempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as s\bsh\bh, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh enters\r\n       _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx mode after the startup files are read.\r\n\r\n       When b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is started in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx mode, as with the  -\b--\b-p\bpo\bos\bsi\bix\bx  command  line\r\n       option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,\r\n       interactive shells expand the E\bEN\bNV\bV variable and commands  are  read  and\r\n       executed  from  the  file  whose  name is the expanded value.  No other\r\n       startup files are read.\r\n\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input\r\n       connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell\r\n       daemon, usually _\br_\bs_\bh_\bd, or the secure shell daemon _\bs_\bs_\bh_\bd.  If b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  deter\u2010\r\n       mines  it  is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands\r\n       from _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\br_\bc, if that file exists and is readable.  It  will  not  do\r\n       this  if  invoked as s\bsh\bh.  The -\b--\b-n\bno\bor\brc\bc option may be used to inhibit this\r\n       behavior, and the -\b--\b-r\brc\bcf\bfi\bil\ble\be option may be used to force another file  to\r\n       be  read,  but  neither  _\br_\bs_\bh_\bd  nor _\bs_\bs_\bh_\bd generally invoke the shell with\r\n       those options or allow them to be specified.\r\n\r\n       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to\r\n       the real user (group) id, and the -\b-p\bp option is not supplied, no startup\r\n       files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,\r\n       the  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bLO\bOP\bPT\bTS\bS, B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHO\bOP\bPT\bTS\bS, C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH, and G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE variables, if they ap\u2010\r\n       pear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is  set\r\n       to  the  real user id.

The first word specifies the command to be executed,\r\n       and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as  ar\u2010\r\n       guments to the invoked command.\r\n\r\n       The  return  value  of a _\bs_\bi_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is its exit status, or 128+_\bn if\r\n       the command is terminated by signal _\bn.\r\n\r\n   P\bPi\bip\bpe\bel\bli\bin\bne\bes\bs\r\n       A _\bp_\bi_\bp_\be_\bl_\bi_\bn_\be is a sequence of one or more commands separated  by  one  of\r\n       the control operators |\b| or |\b|&\b&.  The format for a pipeline is:\r\n\r\n              [t\bti\bim\bme\be [-\b-p\bp]] [ ! ] _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd [ [|\b|\u23aa|\b|&\b&] _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2 ... ]\r\n\r\n       The  standard output of _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is connected via a pipe to the standard\r\n       input of _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2.  This connection is performed  before  any  redirec\u2010\r\n       tions specified by the command (see R\bRE\bED\bDI\bIR\bRE\bEC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN below).  If |\b|&\b& is used,\r\n       _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd's standard error, in addition to its standard output,  is  con\u2010\r\n       nected  to  _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand\r\n       for 2\b2>\b>&\b&1\b1 |\b|.  This implicit redirection of the  standard  error  to  the\r\n       standard  output  is  performed after any redirections specified by the\r\n       command.\r\n\r\n       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,\r\n       unless  the  p\bpi\bip\bpe\bef\bfa\bai\bil\bl  option  is enabled.  If p\bpi\bip\bpe\bef\bfa\bai\bil\bl is enabled, the\r\n       pipeline's return status is the value of the last  (rightmost)  command\r\n       to  exit  with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit success\u2010\r\n       fully.  If the reserved word !\b!  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of\r\n       that  pipeline  is the logical negation of the exit status as described\r\n       above.  The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline  to  terminate\r\n       before returning a value.\r\n\r\n       If  the  t\bti\bim\bme\be reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as\r\n       user and system time consumed by its execution are  reported  when  the\r\n       pipeline  terminates.   The -\b-p\bp option changes the output format to that\r\n       specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be, it does not  rec\u2010\r\n       ognize  t\bti\bim\bme\be  as  a  reserved word if the next token begins with a `-'.\r\n       The T\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT variable may be set to a format  string  that  specifies\r\n       how  the timing information should be displayed; see the description of\r\n       T\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT under S\bSh\bhe\bel\bll\bl V\bVa\bar\bri\bia\bab\bbl\ble\bes\bs below.\r\n\r\n       When the shell is in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be, t\bti\bim\bme\be may be followed by a newline.  In\r\n       this  case,  the shell displays the total user and system time consumed\r\n       by the shell and its children.  The T\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT variable may be used  to\r\n       specify the format of the time information.\r\n\r\n       Each  command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in\r\n       a subshell).  See C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bD E\bEX\bXE\bEC\bCU\bUT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN E\bEN\bNV\bVI\bIR\bRO\bON\bNM\bME\bEN\bNT\bT for a description of  a\r\n       subshell  environment.   If  the  l\bla\bas\bst\btp\bpi\bip\bpe\be  option is enabled using the\r\n       s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin (see the description of s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt below), the last element of\r\n       a pipeline may be run by the shell process.\r\n\r\n   L\bLi\bis\bst\bts\bs\r\n       A  _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the\r\n       operators ;\b;, &\b&, &\b&&\b&, or |\b||\b|, and optionally terminated by one of ;\b;, &\b&, or\r\n       <\b<n\bne\bew\bwl\bli\bin\bne\be>\b>.\r\n\r\n       Of these list operators, &\b&&\b& and |\b||\b| have equal precedence, followed by ;\b;\r\n       and &\b&, which have equal precedence.\r\n\r\n       A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  instead  of  a\r\n       semicolon to delimit commands.\r\n\r\n       If  a  command  is terminated by the control operator &\b&, the shell exe\u2010\r\n       cutes the command in the _\bb_\ba_\bc_\bk_\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd in a subshell.  The shell does  not\r\n       wait  for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.  These are\r\n       referred to as _\ba_\bs_\by_\bn_\bc_\bh_\br_\bo_\bn_\bo_\bu_\bs commands.  Commands separated by  a  ;\b;  are\r\n       executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in\r\n       turn.  The return status is the exit status of the  last  command  exe\u2010\r\n       cuted.\r\n\r\n       AND  and  OR  lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by\r\n       the &\b&&\b& and |\b||\b| control operators, respectively.  AND and  OR  lists  are\r\n       executed with left associativity.  An AND list has the form\r\n\r\n              _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b1 &\b&&\b& _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2\r\n\r\n       _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2  is  executed if, and only if, _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b1 returns an exit status\r\n       of zero (success).\r\n\r\n       An OR list has the form\r\n\r\n              _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b1 |\b||\b| _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2\r\n\r\n       _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b2 is executed if, and only if, _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b1 returns a non-zero  exit\r\n       status.   The  return  status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of\r\n       the last command executed in the list.\r\n\r\n   C\bCo\bom\bmp\bpo\bou\bun\bnd\bd C\bCo\bom\bmm\bma\ban\bnd\bds\bs\r\n       A _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bp_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is one of the following.  In most cases a _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt in  a\r\n       command's  description may be separated from the rest of the command by\r\n       one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in  place  of  a\r\n       semicolon.\r\n\r\n       (_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt) _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  is  executed in a subshell environment (see C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bD E\bEX\bXE\bEC\bCU\bU\u2010\b\u2010\r\n              T\bTI\bIO\bON\bN E\bEN\bNV\bVI\bIR\bRO\bON\bNM\bME\bEN\bNT\bT below).  Variable assignments and builtin  com\u2010\r\n              mands  that  affect the shell's environment do not remain in ef\u2010\r\n              fect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit\r\n              status of _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt.\r\n\r\n       { _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt; }\r\n              _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  is simply executed in the current shell environment.  _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt\r\n              must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This  is  known\r\n              as  a  _\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bp  _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd.   The return status is the exit status of\r\n              _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt.

Since they do not cause a  word  break,  they\r\n              must  be  separated  from  _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  by  whitespace or another shell\r\n              metacharacter.\r\n\r\n       ((_\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\be_\bs_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn))\r\n              The _\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\be_\bs_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn is evaluated according to the rules described be\u2010\r\n              low under A\bAR\bRI\bIT\bTH\bHM\bME\bET\bTI\bIC\bC E\bEV\bVA\bAL\bLU\bUA\bAT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN.  If the value of the expression\r\n              is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status\r\n              is 1.

Condi\u2010\r\n              tional operators such as -\b-f\bf must be unquoted to be recognized as\r\n              primaries.\r\n\r\n              When  used with [\b[[\b[, the <\b< and >\b> operators sort lexicographically\r\n              using the current locale.\r\n\r\n              When the =\b==\b= and !\b!=\b= operators are used, the string to  the  right\r\n              of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to\r\n              the rules described below under P\bPa\bat\btt\bte\ber\brn\bn M\bMa\bat\btc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg, as if the e\bex\bxt\bt\u2010\b\u2010\r\n              g\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell option were enabled.

If the n\bno\boc\bca\bas\bse\bem\bma\bat\btc\bch\bh shell option is enabled,  the  match  is\r\n              performed  without  regard to the case of alphabetic characters.\r\n              The return value is 0 if the string matches  (=\b==\b=)  or  does  not\r\n              match  (!\b!=\b=)  the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  Any part of the pat\u2010\r\n              tern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched  as\r\n              a string.\r\n\r\n              An  additional  binary operator, =\b=~\b~, is available, with the same\r\n              precedence as =\b==\b= and !\b!=\b=.  When it is used,  the  string  to  the\r\n              right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular ex\u2010\r\n              pression and matched accordingly (using the  POSIX  _\br_\be_\bg_\bc_\bo_\bm_\bp  and\r\n              _\br_\be_\bg_\be_\bx_\be_\bc  interfaces  usually described in _\br_\be_\bg_\be_\bx(3)).  The return\r\n              value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and  1  otherwise.\r\n              If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the condi\u2010\r\n              tional expression's return value is 2.  If the n\bno\boc\bca\bas\bse\bem\bma\bat\btc\bch\bh shell\r\n              option  is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the\r\n              case of alphabetic characters.  Any part of the pattern  may  be\r\n              quoted  to  force  the quoted portion to be matched as a string.\r\n              Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated care\u2010\r\n              fully,  since  normal quoting characters lose their meanings be\u2010\r\n              tween brackets.  If the pattern is stored in a  shell  variable,\r\n              quoting  the  variable expansion forces the entire pattern to be\r\n              matched as a string.\r\n\r\n              The pattern will match if it matches any  part  of  the  string.\r\n              Anchor  the  pattern using the ^\b^ and $\b$ regular expression opera\u2010\r\n              tors to force it to match the entire string.

The\r\n              arithmetic expression _\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\b2 is then evaluated  repeatedly  until\r\n              it  evaluates  to zero.  Each time _\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\b2 evaluates to a non-zero\r\n              value, _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt is executed and the arithmetic expression  _\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\b3  is\r\n              evaluated.   If  any  expression is omitted, it behaves as if it\r\n              evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last\r\n              command in _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt that is executed, or false if any of the expres\u2010\r\n              sions is invalid.\r\n\r\n       s\bse\bel\ble\bec\bct\bt _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be [ i\bin\bn _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd ] ; d\bdo\bo _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt ; d\bdo\bon\bne\be\r\n              The list of words following i\bin\bn is expanded, generating a list of\r\n              items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard er\u2010\r\n              ror, each preceded by a number.  If the i\bin\bn _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd is omitted,  the\r\n              positional  parameters  are printed (see P\bPA\bAR\bRA\bAM\bME\bET\bTE\bER\bRS\bS below).  The\r\n              P\bPS\bS3\b3 prompt is then displayed and a line read from  the  standard\r\n              input.  If the line consists of a number corresponding to one of\r\n              the displayed words, then the value of _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is set to that word.\r\n              If  the line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.\r\n              If EOF is read, the command completes.   Any  other  value  read\r\n              causes  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be  to  be set to null.  The line read is saved in the\r\n              variable R\bRE\bEP\bPL\bLY\bY.  The _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt is executed after each selection until\r\n              a  b\bbr\bre\bea\bak\bk  command is executed.  The exit status of s\bse\bel\ble\bec\bct\bt is the\r\n              exit status of the last command executed in _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt, or zero if  no\r\n              commands were executed.\r\n\r\n       c\bca\bas\bse\be _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd i\bin\bn [ [(] _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn [ |\b| _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn ] ... ) _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt ;; ] ... e\bes\bsa\bac\bc\r\n              A c\bca\bas\bse\be command first expands _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd, and tries to match it against\r\n              each _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn in turn, using the matching rules  described  under\r\n              P\bPa\bat\btt\bte\ber\brn\bn M\bMa\bat\btc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg below.

If the  n\bno\boc\bca\bas\bse\bem\bma\bat\btc\bch\bh  shell\r\n              option  is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the\r\n              case of alphabetic characters.  When a match is found, the  cor\u2010\r\n              responding  _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt  is  executed.   If the ;\b;;\b; operator is used, no\r\n              subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern  match.\r\n              Using  ;\b;&\b&  in  place of ;\b;;\b; causes execution to continue with the\r\n              _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt associated with the next set of  patterns.   Using  ;\b;;\b;&\b&  in\r\n              place  of  ;\b;;\b;  causes the shell to test the next pattern list in\r\n              the statement, if any, and execute any associated _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt on a suc\u2010\r\n              cessful match, continuing the case statement execution as if the\r\n              pattern list had not matched.  The exit status  is  zero  if  no\r\n              pattern  matches.

The exit\r\n              status of the w\bwh\bhi\bil\ble\be and u\bun\bnt\bti\bil\bl commands is the exit status of the\r\n              last command executed in _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt_\b-_\b2, or zero if none was executed.\r\n\r\n   C\bCo\bop\bpr\bro\boc\bce\bes\bss\bse\bes\bs\r\n       A _\bc_\bo_\bp_\br_\bo_\bc_\be_\bs_\bs is a shell command preceded by the c\bco\bop\bpr\bro\boc\bc reserved word.  A\r\n       coprocess  is  executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command\r\n       had been terminated with the &\b& control operator, with  a  two-way  pipe\r\n       established between the executing shell and the coprocess.\r\n\r\n       The format for a coprocess is:\r\n\r\n              c\bco\bop\bpr\bro\boc\bc [_\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE] _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd [_\br_\be_\bd_\bi_\br_\be_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs]\r\n\r\n       This  creates a coprocess named _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE.  If _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE is not supplied, the de\u2010\r\n       fault name is C\bCO\bOP\bPR\bRO\bOC\bC.  _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE must not be supplied if _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is a _\bs_\bi_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be\r\n       _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd  (see above); otherwise, it is interpreted as the first word of\r\n       the simple command.  When the coprocess is executed, the shell  creates\r\n       an  array  variable (see A\bAr\brr\bra\bay\bys\bs below) named _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE in the context of the\r\n       executing shell.  The standard output of _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd  is  connected  via  a\r\n       pipe  to  a  file  descriptor in the executing shell, and that file de\u2010\r\n       scriptor is assigned to _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE[0].  The standard input of _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is con\u2010\r\n       nected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that\r\n       file descriptor is assigned to _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE[1].  This pipe is  established  be\u2010\r\n       fore any redirections specified by the command (see R\bRE\bED\bDI\bIR\bRE\bEC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN below).\r\n       The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands and\r\n       redirections  using standard word expansions.  Other than those created\r\n       to execute command and process substitutions, the file descriptors  are\r\n       not available in subshells.  The process ID of the shell spawned to ex\u2010\r\n       ecute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable _\bN_\bA_\bM_\bE_PID.\r\n       The  w\bwa\bai\bit\bt builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to ter\u2010\r\n       minate.\r\n\r\n       Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command,  the  c\bco\bop\bpr\bro\boc\bc\r\n       command  always  returns  success.  The return status of a coprocess is\r\n       the exit status of _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd.\r\n\r\n   S\bSh\bhe\bel\bll\bl F\bFu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bn D\bDe\bef\bfi\bin\bni\bit\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs\r\n       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command  and\r\n       executes  a  compound  command with a new set of positional parameters.\r\n       Shell functions are declared as follows:\r\n\r\n       _\bf_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be () _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bp_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd [_\br_\be_\bd_\bi_\br_\be_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn]\r\n       f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bn _\bf_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be [()] _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bp_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd [_\br_\be_\bd_\bi_\br_\be_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn]\r\n              This defines a function named _\bf_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.

It preserves the\r\n       literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of\r\n       <newline>.   If a \\\b\\<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not it\u2010\r\n       self quoted, the \\\b\\<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that is,\r\n       it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).\r\n\r\n       Enclosing  characters  in  single quotes preserves the literal value of\r\n       each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between\r\n       single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.\r\n\r\n       Enclosing  characters  in  double quotes preserves the literal value of\r\n       all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $\b$, `\b`,  \\\b\\,  and,\r\n       when history expansion is enabled, !\b!.  When the shell is in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be,\r\n       the !\b! has no special meaning within double quotes,  even  when  history\r\n       expansion  is  enabled.   The  characters  $\b$ and `\b` retain their special\r\n       meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special  mean\u2010\r\n       ing  only when followed by one of the following characters: $\b$, `\b`, \"\b\", \\\b\\,\r\n       or <\b<n\bne\bew\bwl\bli\bin\bne\be>\b>.  A double quote may be quoted  within  double  quotes  by\r\n       preceding  it  with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be\r\n       performed unless an !\b!  appearing in double quotes is  escaped  using  a\r\n       backslash.

It can be a _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, a  num\u2010\r\n       ber, or one of the special characters listed below under S\bSp\bpe\bec\bci\bia\bal\bl P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bm\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       e\bet\bte\ber\brs\bs.  A _\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be is a parameter denoted by a _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.  A variable has  a\r\n       _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be  and  zero or more _\ba_\bt_\bt_\br_\bi_\bb_\bu_\bt_\be_\bs.  Attributes are assigned using the\r\n       d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be builtin command (see d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be below in S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS).\r\n\r\n       A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is\r\n       a  valid  value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using\r\n       the u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt builtin command (see S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).\r\n\r\n       A _\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be may be assigned to by a statement of the form\r\n\r\n              _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=[_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be]\r\n\r\n       If _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be is not given, the variable is assigned the null  string.   All\r\n       _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be_\bs  undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, com\u2010\r\n       mand substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see  E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bN\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       S\bSI\bIO\bON\bN below).  If the variable has its i\bin\bnt\bte\beg\bge\ber\br attribute set, then _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be\r\n       is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion\r\n       is  not  used  (see A\bAr\bri\bit\bth\bhm\bme\bet\bti\bic\bc E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn below).  Word splitting is not\r\n       performed, with the exception of \"\b\"$\b$@\b@\"\b\" as explained below under  S\bSp\bpe\bec\bci\bia\bal\bl\r\n       P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\brs\bs.   Pathname  expansion  is not performed.  Assignment state\u2010\r\n       ments may also appear as arguments to the a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs, d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be, t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt,  e\bex\bx\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       p\bpo\bor\brt\bt,  r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by,  and  l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl  builtin  commands (_\bd_\be_\bc_\bl_\ba_\br_\ba_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn commands).\r\n       When in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be, these builtins may appear in a command after one or\r\n       more  instances  of  the  c\bco\bom\bmm\bma\ban\bnd\bd  builtin  and retain these assignment\r\n       statement properties.\r\n\r\n       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to  a\r\n       shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to\r\n       or add to the variable's previous value.  This  includes  arguments  to\r\n       builtin  commands  such  as  d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be  that accept assignment statements\r\n       (_\bd_\be_\bc_\bl_\ba_\br_\ba_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn commands).  When += is applied to a variable for which the\r\n       _\bi_\bn_\bt_\be_\bg_\be_\br attribute has been set, _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be is evaluated as an arithmetic ex\u2010\r\n       pression and added to the variable's current value, which is also eval\u2010\r\n       uated.   When += is applied to an array variable using compound assign\u2010\r\n       ment (see A\bAr\brr\bra\bay\bys\bs below), the variable's value is not unset  (as  it  is\r\n       when  using  =),  and new values are appended to the array beginning at\r\n       one greater than the array's maximum  index  (for  indexed  arrays)  or\r\n       added  as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.  When ap\u2010\r\n       plied to a string-valued variable, _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be is expanded  and  appended  to\r\n       the variable's value.\r\n\r\n       A variable can be assigned the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\br_\be_\bf attribute using the -\b-n\bn option to\r\n       the d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be or l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl builtin commands (see the descriptions of  d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be\r\n       and  l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl  below) to create a _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\br_\be_\bf, or a reference to another vari\u2010\r\n       able.  This allows variables to be  manipulated  indirectly.   Whenever\r\n       the  nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its at\u2010\r\n       tributes modified (other than using or changing the  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\br_\be_\bf  attribute\r\n       itself),  the operation is actually performed on the variable specified\r\n       by the nameref variable's value.  A nameref  is  commonly  used  within\r\n       shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argu\u2010\r\n       ment to the function.  For instance, if a variable name is passed to  a\r\n       shell function as its first argument, running\r\n              declare -n ref=$1\r\n       inside  the  function creates a nameref variable r\bre\bef\bf whose value is the\r\n       variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assignments\r\n       to  r\bre\bef\bf,  and changes to its attributes, are treated as references, as\u2010\r\n       signments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose  name  was\r\n       passed  as  $\b$1\b1.   If the control variable in a f\bfo\bor\br loop has the nameref\r\n       attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell  variables,  and  a\r\n       name  reference will be established for each word in the list, in turn,\r\n       when the loop is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the n\bna\bam\bme\ber\bre\bef\bf\r\n       attribute.   However,  nameref  variables can reference array variables\r\n       and subscripted array variables.  Namerefs can be unset  using  the  -\b-n\bn\r\n       option  to the u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt builtin.  Otherwise, if u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt is executed with the\r\n       name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable  referenced  by\r\n       the nameref variable will be unset.\r\n\r\n   P\bPo\bos\bsi\bit\bti\bio\bon\bna\bal\bl P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\brs\bs\r\n       A  _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\ba_\bl  _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br  is a parameter denoted by one or more digits,\r\n       other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from\r\n       the  shell's  arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using\r\n       the s\bse\bet\bt builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned  to\r\n       with  assignment statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily\r\n       replaced when a shell function is executed (see F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS below).\r\n\r\n       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single  digit  is\r\n       expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN below).\r\n\r\n   S\bSp\bpe\bec\bci\bia\bal\bl P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\brs\bs\r\n       The  shell  treats  several parameters specially.  These parameters may\r\n       only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.\r\n       *\b*      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from  one.   When\r\n              the  expansion  is not within double quotes, each positional pa\u2010\r\n              rameter expands to a separate word.  In  contexts  where  it  is\r\n              performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and\r\n              pathname expansion.  When the  expansion  occurs  within  double\r\n              quotes,  it  expands to a single word with the value of each pa\u2010\r\n              rameter separated by the first  character  of  the  I\bIF\bFS\bS  special\r\n              variable.   That  is, \"$\b$*\b*\" is equivalent to \"$\b$1\b1_\bc$\b$2\b2_\bc.\b..\b..\b.\", where _\bc\r\n              is the first character of the value of the I\bIF\bFS\bS variable.  If I\bIF\bFS\bS\r\n              is  unset,  the  parameters  are separated by spaces.  If I\bIF\bFS\bS is\r\n              null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.\r\n       @\b@      Expands to the positional parameters,  starting  from  one.   In\r\n              contexts  where  word  splitting is performed, this expands each\r\n              positional parameter to a separate word; if  not  within  double\r\n              quotes,  these words are subject to word splitting.  In contexts\r\n              where word splitting is not performed, this expands to a  single\r\n              word  with each positional parameter separated by a space.  When\r\n              the expansion occurs within double quotes,  each  parameter  ex\u2010\r\n              pands  to  a separate word.  That is, \"$\b$@\b@\" is equivalent to \"$\b$1\b1\"\r\n              \"$\b$2\b2\" ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within  a  word,\r\n              the  expansion  of the first parameter is joined with the begin\u2010\r\n              ning part of the original word, and the expansion  of  the  last\r\n              parameter  is  joined  with  the last part of the original word.\r\n              When there are no positional parameters, \"$\b$@\b@\" and $\b$@\b@  expand  to\r\n              nothing (i.e., they are removed).\r\n       #\b#      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.\r\n       ?\b?      Expands  to  the exit status of the most recently executed fore\u2010\r\n              ground pipeline.\r\n       -\b-      Expands to the current option flags as  specified  upon  invoca\u2010\r\n              tion,  by the s\bse\bet\bt builtin command, or those set by the shell it\u2010\r\n              self (such as the -\b-i\bi option).\r\n       $\b$      Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a  ()  subshell,  it\r\n              expands  to  the  process  ID of the current shell, not the sub\u2010\r\n              shell.\r\n       !\b!      Expands to the process ID of the job most recently  placed  into\r\n              the  background,  whether executed as an asynchronous command or\r\n              using the b\bbg\bg builtin (see J\bJO\bOB\bB C\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL below).\r\n       0\b0      Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This  is  set\r\n              at shell initialization.  If b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is invoked with a file of com\u2010\r\n              mands, $\b$0\b0 is set to the name of that file.  If b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  is  started\r\n              with  the  -\b-c\bc option, then $\b$0\b0 is set to the first argument after\r\n              the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it  is\r\n              set  to  the  filename used to invoke b\bba\bas\bsh\bh, as given by argument\r\n              zero.\r\n\r\n   S\bSh\bhe\bel\bll\bl V\bVa\bar\bri\bia\bab\bbl\ble\bes\bs\r\n       The following variables are set by the shell:\r\n\r\n       _\b_      At shell startup, set to the pathname used to invoke  the  shell\r\n              or  shell  script being executed as passed in the environment or\r\n              argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the  last  argument  to\r\n              the  previous  simple  command executed in the foreground, after\r\n              expansion.  Also set to the full pathname used  to  invoke  each\r\n              command  executed and placed in the environment exported to that\r\n              command.  When checking mail, this parameter holds the  name  of\r\n              the mail file currently being checked.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH   Expands  to  the  full  filename used to invoke this instance of\r\n              b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHO\bOP\bPT\bTS\bS\r\n              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each  word  in\r\n              the  list  is  a  valid  argument for the -\b-s\bs option to the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt\r\n              builtin command (see S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).  The options\r\n              appearing  in  B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHO\bOP\bPT\bTS\bS  are  those reported as _\bo_\bn by s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt.  If\r\n              this variable is in the environment when b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  starts  up,  each\r\n              shell  option  in  the  list  will be enabled before reading any\r\n              startup files.  This variable is read-only.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHP\bPI\bID\bD\r\n              Expands to the process ID of the  current  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  process.   This\r\n              differs  from  $\b$$\b$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells\r\n              that do not require b\bba\bas\bsh\bh to be re-initialized.   Assignments  to\r\n              B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHP\bPI\bID\bD  have no effect.  If B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bHP\bPI\bID\bD is unset, it loses its spe\u2010\r\n              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAL\bLI\bIA\bAS\bSE\bES\bS\r\n              An associative array variable whose members  correspond  to  the\r\n              internal  list  of  aliases  as maintained by the a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs builtin.\r\n              Elements added to this array appear in the alias list;  however,\r\n              unsetting  array elements currently does not cause aliases to be\r\n              removed from the alias list.  If B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAL\bLI\bIA\bAS\bSE\bES\bS is unset, it loses\r\n              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAR\bRG\bGC\bC\r\n              An  array  variable whose values are the number of parameters in\r\n              each frame of the current b\bba\bas\bsh\bh execution call stack.  The number\r\n              of  parameters  to  the  current  subroutine  (shell function or\r\n              script executed with .\b. or s\bso\bou\bur\brc\bce\be) is at the top  of  the  stack.\r\n              When  a  subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed\r\n              is pushed onto B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAR\bRG\bGC\bC.  The shell sets B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAR\bRG\bGC\bC only when in\r\n              extended debugging mode (see the description of the e\bex\bxt\btd\bde\beb\bbu\bug\bg op\u2010\r\n              tion to the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin below).

The random number generator is not linear on\r\n              systems that support /dev/urandom or  _\ba_\br_\bc_\b4_\br_\ba_\bn_\bd_\bo_\bm,  so  each  re\u2010\r\n              turned  number  has no relationship to the numbers preceding it.\r\n              The random number generator cannot be seeded, so assignments  to\r\n              this variable have no effect.

The value may be a dec\u2010\r\n              imal  number  (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding\r\n              to the desired compatibility level.  If B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bPA\bAT\bT is unset  or\r\n              set  to  the empty string, the compatibility level is set to the\r\n              default for the current version.  If B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bPA\bAT\bT  is  set  to  a\r\n              value  that  is  not  one of the valid compatibility levels, the\r\n              shell prints an error message and sets the  compatibility  level\r\n              to the default for the current version.

The value of B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_E\bEN\bNV\bV is\r\n              subjected to  parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,  and\r\n              arithmetic  expansion  before  being  interpreted as a filename.\r\n              P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH is not used to search for the resultant filename.\r\n       B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_X\bXT\bTR\bRA\bAC\bCE\bEF\bFD\bD\r\n              If set to an integer corresponding to a valid  file  descriptor,\r\n              b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  will  write  the trace output generated when _\bs_\be_\bt _\b-_\bx is en\u2010\r\n              abled to that file descriptor.

The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line\r\n              compound command are not tested, and are added  to  the  history\r\n              regardless of the value of H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTC\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL.\r\n       H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE\r\n              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see H\bHI\bIS\bS\u2010\b\u2010\r\n              T\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY below).  The default value is _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\b__\bh_\bi_\bs_\bt_\bo_\br_\by.   If  unset,\r\n              the command history is not saved when a shell exits.\r\n       H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bES\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE\r\n              The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When\r\n              this variable is assigned a value, the  history  file  is  trun\u2010\r\n              cated,  if  necessary,  to  contain  no more than that number of\r\n              lines by removing the oldest entries.  The history file is  also\r\n              truncated  to this size after writing it when a shell exits.  If\r\n              the value is 0, the history file  is  truncated  to  zero  size.\r\n              Non-numeric  values  and  numeric  values less than zero inhibit\r\n              truncation.  The shell sets the default value to  the  value  of\r\n              H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE after reading any startup files.\r\n       H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE\r\n              A  colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command\r\n              lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is  an\u2010\r\n              chored  at the beginning of the line and must match the complete\r\n              line (no implicit `*\b*' is  appended).   Each  pattern  is  tested\r\n              against  the  line after the checks specified by H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTC\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL are\r\n              applied.  In addition to the normal shell pattern matching char\u2010\r\n              acters,  `&\b&'  matches the previous history line.  `&\b&' may be es\u2010\r\n              caped using a backslash; the backslash  is  removed  before  at\u2010\r\n              tempting  a  match.  The second and subsequent lines of a multi-\r\n              line compound command are not tested, and are added to the  his\u2010\r\n              tory  regardless of the value of H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE.  The pattern match\u2010\r\n              ing honors the setting of the e\bex\bxt\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell option.\r\n       H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE\r\n              The number of commands to remember in the command  history  (see\r\n              H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY  below).   If  the value is 0, commands are not saved in\r\n              the history list.  Numeric values less than zero result in every\r\n              command  being  saved  on  the history list (there is no limit).\r\n              The shell sets the  default  value  to  500  after  reading  any\r\n              startup files.\r\n       H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTT\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT\r\n              If  this  variable  is  set and not null, its value is used as a\r\n              format string for _\bs_\bt_\br_\bf_\bt_\bi_\bm_\be(3) to print the time stamp associated\r\n              with  each  history  entry displayed by the h\bhi\bis\bst\bto\bor\bry\by builtin.  If\r\n              this variable is set, time stamps are  written  to  the  history\r\n              file  so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses\r\n              the history comment character  to  distinguish  timestamps  from\r\n              other history lines.\r\n       H\bHO\bOM\bME\bE   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for\r\n              the c\bcd\bd builtin command.

If H\bHO\bOS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE is set, but  has\r\n              no  value,  or  does  not name a readable file, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh attempts to\r\n              read _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bh_\bo_\bs_\bt_\bs to obtain the list of possible hostname  comple\u2010\r\n              tions.  When H\bHO\bOS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE is unset, the hostname list is cleared.\r\n       I\bIF\bFS\bS    The _\bI_\bn_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\ba_\bl _\bF_\bi_\be_\bl_\bd _\bS_\be_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bt_\bo_\br that is used for word splitting af\u2010\r\n              ter expansion and to  split  lines  into  words  with  the  r\bre\bea\bad\bd\r\n              builtin  command.   The  default  value  is  ``<space><tab><new\u2010\r\n              line>''.\r\n       I\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bEE\bEO\bOF\bF\r\n              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an E\bEO\bOF\bF\r\n              character as the sole input.

If the variable\r\n              exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no  value,  the\r\n              default  value  is  10.  If it does not exist, E\bEO\bOF\bF signifies the\r\n              end of input to the shell.\r\n       I\bIN\bNP\bPU\bUT\bTR\bRC\bC\r\n              The filename for the r\bre\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be startup file, overriding  the  de\u2010\r\n              fault of _\b~_\b/_\b._\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc (see R\bRE\bEA\bAD\bDL\bLI\bIN\bNE\bE below).\r\n       I\bIN\bNS\bSI\bID\bDE\bE_\b_E\bEM\bMA\bAC\bCS\bS\r\n              If  this  variable  appears  in  the  environment when the shell\r\n              starts, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh assumes that it is running inside  an  Emacs  shell\r\n              buffer  and  may disable line editing, depending on the value of\r\n              T\bTE\bER\bRM\bM.\r\n       L\bLA\bAN\bNG\bG   Used to determine the  locale  category  for  any  category  not\r\n              specifically selected with a variable starting with L\bLC\bC_\b_.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_A\bAL\bLL\bL This  variable  overrides  the  value  of L\bLA\bAN\bNG\bG and any other L\bLC\bC_\b_\r\n              variable specifying a locale category.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_C\bCO\bOL\bLL\bLA\bAT\bTE\bE\r\n              This variable determines the collation order used  when  sorting\r\n              the  results  of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior\r\n              of range expressions, equivalence  classes,  and  collating  se\u2010\r\n              quences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_C\bCT\bTY\bYP\bPE\bE\r\n              This  variable  determines  the interpretation of characters and\r\n              the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion  and\r\n              pattern matching.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_M\bME\bES\bSS\bSA\bAG\bGE\bES\bS\r\n              This  variable  determines  the locale used to translate double-\r\n              quoted strings preceded by a $\b$.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_N\bNU\bUM\bME\bER\bRI\bIC\bC\r\n              This variable determines the locale  category  used  for  number\r\n              formatting.\r\n       L\bLC\bC_\b_T\bTI\bIM\bME\bE\r\n              This  variable  determines the locale category used for data and\r\n              time formatting.\r\n       L\bLI\bIN\bNE\bES\bS  Used by the s\bse\bel\ble\bec\bct\bt compound  command  to  determine  the  column\r\n              length  for  printing selection lists.

A zero-length (null) directory  name  in  the\r\n              value of P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH indicates the current directory.  A null directory\r\n              name may appear as two adjacent colons,  or  as  an  initial  or\r\n              trailing  colon.   The  default path is system-dependent, and is\r\n              set by the administrator who installs b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.

A value of 0 causes\r\n              no decimal point or fraction to be output.  At most three places\r\n              after  the  decimal  point may be specified; values of _\bp greater\r\n              than 3 are changed to 3.  If _\bp is not specified, the value 3  is\r\n              used.\r\n\r\n              The  optional l\bl specifies a longer format, including minutes, of\r\n              the form _\bM_\bMm_\bS_\bS._\bF_\bFs.  The value of _\bp determines  whether  or  not\r\n              the fraction is included.\r\n\r\n              If  this  variable  is not set, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh acts as if it had the value\r\n              $\b$'\b'\\\b\\n\bnr\bre\bea\bal\bl\\\b\\t\bt%\b%3\b3l\blR\bR\\\b\\n\bnu\bus\bse\ber\br\\\b\\t\bt%\b%3\b3l\blU\bU\\\b\\n\bns\bsy\bys\bs\\\b\\t\bt%\b%3\b3l\blS\bS'\b'.  If the value  is  null,\r\n              no timing information is displayed.  A trailing newline is added\r\n              when the format string is displayed.\r\n       T\bTM\bMO\bOU\bUT\bT  If set to a value greater than zero, T\bTM\bMO\bOU\bUT\bT is treated as the de\u2010\r\n              fault  timeout  for the r\bre\bea\bad\bd builtin.  The s\bse\bel\ble\bec\bct\bt command termi\u2010\r\n              nates if input does not arrive after T\bTM\bMO\bOU\bUT\bT seconds when input is\r\n              coming  from  a terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value is\r\n              interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input\r\n              after issuing the primary prompt.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh terminates after waiting\r\n              for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does  not\r\n              arrive.\r\n       T\bTM\bMP\bPD\bDI\bIR\bR If  set, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh uses its value as the name of a directory in which\r\n              b\bba\bas\bsh\bh creates temporary files for the shell's use.\r\n       a\bau\but\bto\bo_\b_r\bre\bes\bsu\bum\bme\be\r\n              This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and\r\n              job  control.   If this variable is set, single word simple com\u2010\r\n              mands without redirections are treated as candidates for resump\u2010\r\n              tion of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed;\r\n              if there is more than one job beginning with the  string  typed,\r\n              the  job  most  recently  accessed  is  selected.  The _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be of a\r\n              stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to  start\r\n              it.   If  set to the value _\be_\bx_\ba_\bc_\bt, the string supplied must match\r\n              the name of a stopped job exactly;  if  set  to  _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg,  the\r\n              string  supplied  needs  to  match  a substring of the name of a\r\n              stopped job.  The _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg value provides functionality  analo\u2010\r\n              gous  to the %\b%?\b?  job identifier (see J\bJO\bOB\bB C\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL below).  If set\r\n              to any other value, the supplied string must be a  prefix  of  a\r\n              stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the\r\n              %\b%_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg job identifier.\r\n       h\bhi\bis\bst\btc\bch\bha\bar\brs\bs\r\n              The two or three characters which control history expansion  and\r\n              tokenization (see H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN below).  The first character\r\n              is the _\bh_\bi_\bs_\bt_\bo_\br_\by _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn character, the character which  signals\r\n              the  start  of  a  history  expansion, normally `!\b!'.  The second\r\n              character is the _\bq_\bu_\bi_\bc_\bk _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bt_\bi_\bt_\bu_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn character, which is used  as\r\n              shorthand  for  re-running the previous command entered, substi\u2010\r\n              tuting one string for another in the command.   The  default  is\r\n              `^\b^'.   The optional third character is the character which indi\u2010\r\n              cates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found  as\r\n              the  first  character of a word, normally `#\b#'.  The history com\u2010\r\n              ment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the\r\n              remaining  words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the\r\n              shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.\r\n\r\n   A\bAr\brr\bra\bay\bys\bs\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array  variables.\r\n       Any  variable may be used as an indexed array; the d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be builtin will\r\n       explicitly declare an array.  There is no maximum limit on the size  of\r\n       an  array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned con\u2010\r\n       tiguously.  Indexed arrays are  referenced  using  integers  (including\r\n       arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are ref\u2010\r\n       erenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless otherwise noted, indexed array\r\n       indices must be non-negative integers.\r\n\r\n       An  indexed  array is created automatically if any variable is assigned\r\n       to using the syntax _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be.  The _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt is treated as\r\n       an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number.  To explicitly\r\n       declare an indexed array, use d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be -\b-a\ba _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be (see S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL  B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN  C\bCO\bOM\bM\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       M\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS  below).   d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be  -\b-a\ba _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[\b[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]\b] is also accepted; the _\bs_\bu_\bb_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt is ignored.\r\n\r\n       Associative arrays are created using d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be -\b-A\bA _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.\r\n\r\n       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be and\r\n       r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.\r\n\r\n       Arrays   are  assigned  to  using  compound  assignments  of  the  form\r\n       _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=(\b(value_\b1 ... value_\bn)\b), where each _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be may be  of  the  form  [_\bs_\bu_\bb_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]=_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg.   Indexed array assignments do not require anything but\r\n       _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg.  Each _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be in the list is expanded using all the shell  expan\u2010\r\n       sions  described  below under E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN.  When assigning to indexed ar\u2010\r\n       rays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied,  that  index\r\n       is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last\r\n       index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.\r\n\r\n       When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assign\u2010\r\n       ment  may  be  either assignment statements, for which the subscript is\r\n       required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence  of  al\u2010\r\n       ternating  keys and values: _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=(\b( _\bk_\be_\by_\b1 _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be_\b1 _\bk_\be_\by_\b2 _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be_\b2 ...)\b).  These\r\n       are treated identically to  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=(\b(  [_\bk_\be_\by_\b1]=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be_\b1  [_\bk_\be_\by_\b2]=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be_\b2  ...)\b).\r\n       The  first  word in the list determines how the remaining words are in\u2010\r\n       terpreted; all assignments in a list must be of the  same  type.   When\r\n       using  key/value  pairs,  the keys may not be missing or empty; a final\r\n       missing value is treated like the empty string.\r\n\r\n       This syntax is also accepted by the d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be builtin.  Individual  array\r\n       elements  may be assigned to using the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be syntax in\u2010\r\n       troduced above.  When assigning to an indexed array, if  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be  is  sub\u2010\r\n       scripted  by  a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative\r\n       to one greater than the maximum index  of  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be,  so  negative  indices\r\n       count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the\r\n       last element.\r\n\r\n       Any element of an array may  be  referenced  using  ${_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]}.\r\n       The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If\r\n       _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt is @\b@ or *\b*, the word expands to all members  of  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.   These\r\n       subscripts  differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If\r\n       the word is double-quoted, ${_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[*]} expands to a single word with the\r\n       value  of each array member separated by the first character of the I\bIF\bFS\bS\r\n       special variable, and ${_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[@]} expands each element of _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be to a sep\u2010\r\n       arate  word.   When  there  are no array members, ${_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[@]} expands to\r\n       nothing.  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the  ex\u2010\r\n       pansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the\r\n       original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is  joined  with\r\n       the last part of the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion\r\n       of the special parameters *\b*  and  @\b@  (see  S\bSp\bpe\bec\bci\bia\bal\bl  P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\brs\bs  above).\r\n       ${#_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]}  expands  to  the length of ${_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt]}.  If\r\n       _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt is *\b* or @\b@, the expansion is the number of elements in the ar\u2010\r\n       ray.  If the _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt used to reference an element of an indexed array\r\n       evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative  to\r\n       one  greater  than  the maximum index of the array, so negative indices\r\n       count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the\r\n       last element.\r\n\r\n       Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to ref\u2010\r\n       erencing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a  variable\r\n       using a valid subscript is legal, and b\bba\bas\bsh\bh will create an array if nec\u2010\r\n       essary.\r\n\r\n       An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned  a\r\n       value.  The null string is a valid value.\r\n\r\n       It  is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the\r\n       values.  ${!\b!_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\b@]} and ${!\b!_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\b*]} expand to the indices assigned  in\r\n       array variable _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.  The treatment when in double quotes is similar to\r\n       the expansion of the special parameters _\b@ and _\b* within double quotes.\r\n\r\n       The u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt builtin is used to destroy arrays.  u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt] de\u2010\r\n       stroys the array element at index _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt, for both indexed and asso\u2010\r\n       ciative arrays.  Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are  interpreted\r\n       as  described  above.   Unsetting the last element of an array variable\r\n       does not unset the variable.  u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, where _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is  an  array,  or\r\n       u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[_\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt],  where  _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt is *\b* or @\b@, removes the entire\r\n       array.\r\n\r\n       When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument  to  a  com\u2010\r\n       mand,  such  as with u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt, without using the word expansion syntax de\u2010\r\n       scribed above, the argument is subject to pathname expansion.  If path\u2010\r\n       name expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.\r\n\r\n       The  d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be,  l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl,  and r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by builtins each accept a -\b-a\ba option to\r\n       specify an indexed array and a -\b-A\bA option to specify an associative  ar\u2010\r\n       ray.   If  both  options  are  supplied, -\b-A\bA takes precedence.  The r\bre\bea\bad\bd\r\n       builtin accepts a -\b-a\ba option to assign a list of  words  read  from  the\r\n       standard input to an array.  The s\bse\bet\bt and d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be builtins display array\r\n       values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.\r\n\r\nE\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into\r\n       words.   There are seven kinds of expansion performed: _\bb_\br_\ba_\bc_\be _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn,\r\n       _\bt_\bi_\bl_\bd_\be _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn, _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br _\ba_\bn_\bd _\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be  _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn,  _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd  _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bt_\bi_\bt_\bu_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn, _\ba_\br_\bi_\bt_\bh_\bm_\be_\bt_\bi_\bc _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn, _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd _\bs_\bp_\bl_\bi_\bt_\bt_\bi_\bn_\bg, and _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn.\r\n\r\n       The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter\r\n       and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command  substitution\r\n       (done  in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expan\u2010\r\n       sion.\r\n\r\n       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion avail\u2010\r\n       able:  _\bp_\br_\bo_\bc_\be_\bs_\bs  _\bs_\bu_\bb_\bs_\bt_\bi_\bt_\bu_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn.   This  is  performed at the same time as\r\n       tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and  command  sub\u2010\r\n       stitution.\r\n\r\n       After  these  expansions are performed, quote characters present in the\r\n       original word are removed  unless  they  have  been  quoted  themselves\r\n       (_\bq_\bu_\bo_\bt_\be _\br_\be_\bm_\bo_\bv_\ba_\bl).\r\n\r\n       Only  brace  expansion,  word splitting, and pathname expansion can in\u2010\r\n       crease the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand  a\r\n       single  word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are the ex\u2010\r\n       pansions  of  \"$\b$@\b@\"  and  \"$\b${\b{_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[\b[@\b@]\b]}\b}\",  and,  in  most  cases,  $\b$*\b*  and\r\n       $\b${\b{_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[\b[*\b*]\b]}\b} as explained above (see P\bPA\bAR\bRA\bAM\bME\bET\bTE\bER\bRS\bS).\r\n\r\n   B\bBr\bra\bac\bce\be E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n       _\bB_\br_\ba_\bc_\be _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be gener\u2010\r\n       ated.  This mechanism is similar to _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn, but  the  file\u2010\r\n       names generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take the\r\n       form of an optional _\bp_\br_\be_\ba_\bm_\bb_\bl_\be, followed by either a series of comma-sep\u2010\r\n       arated  strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, fol\u2010\r\n       lowed by an optional _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bt_\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt.  The  preamble  is  prefixed  to  each\r\n       string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended\r\n       to each resulting string, expanding left to right.\r\n\r\n       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of  each  expanded  string\r\n       are  not  sorted;  left  to  right  order  is  preserved.  For example,\r\n       a{\b{d,c,b}\b}e expands into `ade ace abe'.\r\n\r\n       A sequence expression takes the form {\b{_\bx.\b..\b._\by[\b[.\b..\b._\bi_\bn_\bc_\br]\b]}\b}, where _\bx and _\by  are\r\n       either  integers or single characters, and _\bi_\bn_\bc_\br, an optional increment,\r\n       is an integer.  When integers are supplied, the expression  expands  to\r\n       each  number between _\bx and _\by, inclusive.  Supplied integers may be pre\u2010\r\n       fixed with _\b0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either  _\bx\r\n       or  _\by  begins  with  a  zero, the shell attempts to force all generated\r\n       terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding  where  neces\u2010\r\n       sary.   When  characters  are  supplied, the expression expands to each\r\n       character lexicographically between _\bx and _\by, inclusive, using  the  de\u2010\r\n       fault C locale.  Note that both _\bx and _\by must be of the same type.  When\r\n       the increment is supplied, it is used as the  difference  between  each\r\n       term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.\r\n\r\n       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any char\u2010\r\n       acters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It  is\r\n       strictly  textual.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh does not apply any syntactic interpretation to\r\n       the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.\r\n\r\n       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain  unquoted  opening  and\r\n       closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence ex\u2010\r\n       pression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.  A\r\n       {\b{  or  ,\b, may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered\r\n       part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with  parameter  expan\u2010\r\n       sion, the string $\b${\b{ is not considered eligible for brace expansion, and\r\n       inhibits brace expansion until the closing }\b}.\r\n\r\n       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of\r\n       the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:\r\n\r\n              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}\r\n       or\r\n              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}\r\n\r\n       Brace  expansion  introduces  a  slight incompatibility with historical\r\n       versions of s\bsh\bh.  s\bsh\bh does not treat opening or closing braces  specially\r\n       when  they  appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh removes braces from words as a  consequence  of  brace  expansion.\r\n       For  example,  a word entered to s\bsh\bh as _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be_\b{_\b1_\b,_\b2_\b} appears identically in\r\n       the output.  The same word is output as _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be_\b1 _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be_\b2 after expansion  by\r\n       b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.   If strict compatibility with s\bsh\bh is desired, start b\bba\bas\bsh\bh with the\r\n       +\b+B\bB option or disable brace expansion with the +\b+B\bB option to the s\bse\bet\bt com\u2010\r\n       mand (see S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).\r\n\r\n   T\bTi\bil\bld\bde\be E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n       If  a  word  begins  with an unquoted tilde character (`~\b~'), all of the\r\n       characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or  all  characters,  if\r\n       there  is no unquoted slash) are considered a _\bt_\bi_\bl_\bd_\be_\b-_\bp_\br_\be_\bf_\bi_\bx.  If none of\r\n       the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the  characters  in  the\r\n       tilde-prefix  following the tilde are treated as a possible _\bl_\bo_\bg_\bi_\bn _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.\r\n       If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced  with  the\r\n       value  of  the shell parameter H\bHO\bOM\bME\bE.  If H\bHO\bOM\bME\bE is unset, the home direc\u2010\r\n       tory of the user executing the shell is  substituted  instead.   Other\u2010\r\n       wise,  the  tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated\r\n       with the specified login name.\r\n\r\n       If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable P\bPW\bWD\bD  re\u2010\r\n       places  the  tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of\r\n       the shell variable O\bOL\bLD\bDP\bPW\bWD\bD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the  char\u2010\r\n       acters  following  the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number _\bN,\r\n       optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-',  the  tilde-prefix  is  replaced\r\n       with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be\r\n       displayed by the d\bdi\bir\brs\bs builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argu\u2010\r\n       ment.   If  the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix con\u2010\r\n       sist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.\r\n\r\n       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is\r\n       unchanged.\r\n\r\n       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immedi\u2010\r\n       ately following a :\b: or the first =\b=.  In these cases, tilde expansion is\r\n       also performed.  Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in as\u2010\r\n       signments to P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH, M\bMA\bAI\bIL\bLP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH, and C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH, and the shell assigns the  ex\u2010\r\n       panded value.\r\n\r\n       Bash  also  performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions\r\n       of variable assignments (as described above under P\bPA\bAR\bRA\bAM\bME\bET\bTE\bER\bRS\bS) when they\r\n       appear  as arguments to simple commands.  Bash does not do this, except\r\n       for the _\bd_\be_\bc_\bl_\ba_\br_\ba_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn commands listed above, when in _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be.\r\n\r\n   P\bPa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\br E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n       The `$\b$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,\r\n       or  arithmetic  expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded\r\n       may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect  the\r\n       variable  to be expanded from characters immediately following it which\r\n       could be interpreted as part of the name.\r\n\r\n       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the  first  `}\b}'  not\r\n       escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an em\u2010\r\n       bedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter  expan\u2010\r\n       sion.\r\n\r\n       ${_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br}\r\n              The  value of _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br is substituted.

The _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br is a shell\r\n              parameter  as  described above P\bPA\bAR\bRA\bAM\bME\bET\bTE\bER\bRS\bS) or an array reference\r\n              (A\bAr\brr\bra\bay\bys\bs).\r\n\r\n       If the first character of _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br is an exclamation  point  (!\b!),  and\r\n       _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br is not a _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\br_\be_\bf, it introduces a level of indirection.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh\r\n       uses the value formed by expanding the rest of _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br as the new _\bp_\ba_\b\u2010\r\n       _\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br;  this  is  then expanded and that value is used in the rest of\r\n       the expansion, rather than the expansion  of  the  original  _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm_\be_\bt_\be_\br.\r\n       This is known as _\bi_\bn_\bd_\bi_\br_\be_\bc_\bt _\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn.

If  _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg  is null, matches of _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn are deleted\r\n              and the /\b/ following _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn may be omitted.

Embedded newlines are\r\n       not  deleted,  but they may be removed during word splitting.  The com\u2010\r\n       mand substitution $\b$(\b(c\bca\bat\bt _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be)\b) can be replaced  by  the  equivalent  but\r\n       faster $\b$(\b(<\b< _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be)\b).\r\n\r\n       When  the  old-style  backquote form of substitution is used, backslash\r\n       retains its literal meaning except when followed by $\b$, `\b`,  or  \\\b\\.   The\r\n       first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command sub\u2010\r\n       stitution.  When using the $(_\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd) form, all characters between  the\r\n       parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.\r\n\r\n       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted\r\n       form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.\r\n\r\n       If the substitution appears within double quotes,  word  splitting  and\r\n       pathname expansion are not performed on the results.\r\n\r\n   A\bAr\bri\bit\bth\bhm\bme\bet\bti\bic\bc E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n       Arithmetic  expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression\r\n       and the substitution of the result.

The\r\n       process _\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears  as\r\n       a filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current com\u2010\r\n       mand as the result of the expansion.

Process substitution is supported on systems that sup\u2010\r\n       port named pipes (_\bF_\bI_\bF_\bO_\bs) or the /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/f\bfd\bd method of naming open files.\r\n\r\n       When available, process substitution is performed  simultaneously  with\r\n       parameter  and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic\r\n       expansion.\r\n\r\n   W\bWo\bor\brd\bd S\bSp\bpl\bli\bit\btt\bti\bin\bng\bg\r\n       The shell scans the results of parameter expansion,  command  substitu\u2010\r\n       tion,  and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes\r\n       for _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd _\bs_\bp_\bl_\bi_\bt_\bt_\bi_\bn_\bg.\r\n\r\n       The shell treats each character of I\bIF\bFS\bS as a delimiter, and  splits  the\r\n       results  of  the  other expansions into words using these characters as\r\n       field  terminators.

If I\bIF\bFS\bS  has  a  value  other\r\n       than  the  default,  then sequences of the whitespace characters s\bsp\bpa\bac\bce\be,\r\n       t\bta\bab\bb, and n\bne\bew\bwl\bli\bin\bne\be are ignored at the beginning and end of the  word,  as\r\n       long  as the whitespace character is in the value of I\bIF\bFS\bS (an I\bIF\bFS\bS white\u2010\r\n       space character).  Any character in I\bIF\bFS\bS that  is  not  I\bIF\bFS\bS  whitespace,\r\n       along with any adjacent I\bIF\bFS\bS whitespace characters, delimits a field.  A\r\n       sequence of I\bIF\bFS\bS whitespace characters is also treated as  a  delimiter.\r\n       If the value of I\bIF\bFS\bS is null, no word splitting occurs.\r\n\r\n       Explicit  null arguments (\"\b\"\"\b\" or '\b''\b') are retained and passed to commands\r\n       as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the\r\n       expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed.  If a parame\u2010\r\n       ter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument re\u2010\r\n       sults and is retained and passed to a command as an empty string.  When\r\n       a quoted null argument appears as part of a  word  whose  expansion  is\r\n       non-null, the null argument is removed.  That is, the word -d'' becomes\r\n       -d after word splitting and null argument removal.\r\n\r\n       Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.\r\n\r\n   P\bPa\bat\bth\bhn\bna\bam\bme\be E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n       After word splitting, unless the -\b-f\bf option has  been  set,  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  scans\r\n       each  word  for the characters *\b*, ?\b?, and [\b[.  If one of these characters\r\n       appears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as a _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn, and\r\n       replaced  with  an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the\r\n       pattern (see P\bPa\bat\btt\bte\ber\brn\bn M\bMa\bat\btc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg below).

The filenames `\b``\b`.\b.'\b''\b'\r\n       and `\b``\b`.\b..\b.'\b''\b'  must always be matched explicitly, even if d\bdo\bot\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb is  set.\r\n       In  other  cases,  the `\b``\b`.\b.'\b''\b'  character is not treated specially.  When\r\n       matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explic\u2010\r\n       itly  by  a slash in the pattern, but in other matching contexts it can\r\n       be matched by a special pattern character as described below under P\bPa\bat\bt\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       t\bte\ber\brn\bn  M\bMa\bat\btc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg.

If G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE is  set,  each  matching  file\r\n       name  that  also  matches  one of the patterns in G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE is removed\r\n       from the list of matches.  If the n\bno\boc\bca\bas\bse\beg\bgl\blo\bob\bb option is set, the  match\u2010\r\n       ing  against  the patterns in G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE is performed without regard to\r\n       case.  The filenames `\b``\b`.\b.'\b''\b'  and `\b``\b`.\b..\b.'\b''\b'  are always ignored when G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bG\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       N\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE  is  set  and not null.  However, setting G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE to a non-null\r\n       value has the effect of enabling the d\bdo\bot\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell option, so all other\r\n       filenames  beginning with a `\b``\b`.\b.'\b''\b'  will match.  To get the old behavior\r\n       of ignoring filenames beginning with a `\b``\b`.\b.'\b''\b', make `\b``\b`.\b.*\b*'\b''\b'  one  of  the\r\n       patterns in G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE.  The d\bdo\bot\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb option is disabled when G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE\r\n       is unset.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the e\bex\bxt\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell\r\n       option.\r\n\r\n       P\bPa\bat\btt\bte\ber\brn\bn M\bMa\bat\btc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg\r\n\r\n       Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern\r\n       characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may  not\r\n       occur  in  a pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the\r\n       escaping backslash is discarded when  matching.   The  special  pattern\r\n       characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.\r\n\r\n       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:\r\n\r\n              *\b*      Matches  any string, including the null string.  When the\r\n                     g\bgl\blo\bob\bbs\bst\bta\bar\br shell option is enabled, and  *\b*  is  used  in  a\r\n                     pathname  expansion  context,  two  adjacent *\b*s used as a\r\n                     single pattern will match all files and zero or more  di\u2010\r\n                     rectories  and  subdirectories.   If followed by a /\b/, two\r\n                     adjacent *\b*s will match only directories  and  subdirecto\u2010\r\n                     ries.\r\n              ?\b?      Matches any single character.\r\n              [\b[.\b..\b..\b.]\b]  Matches  any  one  of the enclosed characters.  A pair of\r\n                     characters separated by a hyphen denotes a _\br_\ba_\bn_\bg_\be  _\be_\bx_\bp_\br_\be_\bs_\b\u2010\r\n                     _\bs_\bi_\bo_\bn;  any character that falls between those two charac\u2010\r\n                     ters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating se\u2010\r\n                     quence and character set, is matched.  If the first char\u2010\r\n                     acter following the [\b[ is a !\b!  or a ^\b^ then  any  character\r\n                     not enclosed is matched.  The sorting order of characters\r\n                     in range expressions is determined by the current  locale\r\n                     and  the  values  of the L\bLC\bC_\b_C\bCO\bOL\bLL\bLA\bAT\bTE\bE or L\bLC\bC_\b_A\bAL\bLL\bL shell vari\u2010\r\n                     ables, if set.  To obtain the traditional  interpretation\r\n                     of  range  expressions,  where  [\b[a\ba-\b-d\bd]\b]  is  equivalent  to\r\n                     [\b[a\bab\bbc\bcd\bd]\b], set value of the L\bLC\bC_\b_A\bAL\bLL\bL shell variable to  C\bC,  or\r\n                     enable  the  g\bgl\blo\bob\bba\bas\bsc\bci\bii\bir\bra\ban\bng\bge\bes\bs  shell  option.   A -\b- may be\r\n                     matched by including it as the first or last character in\r\n                     the set.  A ]\b] may be matched by including it as the first\r\n                     character in the set.\r\n\r\n                     Within [\b[ and ]\b], _\bc_\bh_\ba_\br_\ba_\bc_\bt_\be_\br _\bc_\bl_\ba_\bs_\bs_\be_\bs can be specified  using\r\n                     the syntax [\b[:\b:_\bc_\bl_\ba_\bs_\bs:\b:]\b], where _\bc_\bl_\ba_\bs_\bs is one of the following\r\n                     classes defined in the POSIX standard:\r\n                     a\bal\bln\bnu\bum\bm a\bal\blp\bph\bha\ba a\bas\bsc\bci\bii\bi b\bbl\bla\ban\bnk\bk c\bcn\bnt\btr\brl\bl  d\bdi\big\bgi\bit\bt  g\bgr\bra\bap\bph\bh  l\blo\bow\bwe\ber\br  p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt\r\n                     p\bpu\bun\bnc\bct\bt s\bsp\bpa\bac\bce\be u\bup\bpp\bpe\ber\br w\bwo\bor\brd\bd x\bxd\bdi\big\bgi\bit\bt\r\n                     A character class matches any character belonging to that\r\n                     class.  The w\bwo\bor\brd\bd character class matches letters, digits,\r\n                     and the character _.\r\n\r\n                     Within [\b[ and ]\b], an _\be_\bq_\bu_\bi_\bv_\ba_\bl_\be_\bn_\bc_\be _\bc_\bl_\ba_\bs_\bs can be specified us\u2010\r\n                     ing the syntax [\b[=\b=_\bc=\b=]\b], which matches all  characters  with\r\n                     the  same collation weight (as defined by the current lo\u2010\r\n                     cale) as the character _\bc.\r\n\r\n                     Within [\b[ and ]\b], the syntax [\b[.\b._\bs_\by_\bm_\bb_\bo_\bl.\b.]\b] matches the collat\u2010\r\n                     ing symbol _\bs_\by_\bm_\bb_\bo_\bl.\r\n\r\n       If the e\bex\bxt\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell option is enabled using the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin, several\r\n       extended pattern matching operators are recognized.  In  the  following\r\n       description, a _\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt is a list of one or more patterns separated\r\n       by a |\b|.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the fol\u2010\r\n       lowing sub-patterns:\r\n\r\n              ?\b?(\b(_\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt)\b)\r\n                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns\r\n              *\b*(\b(_\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt)\b)\r\n                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns\r\n              +\b+(\b(_\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt)\b)\r\n                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns\r\n              @\b@(\b(_\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt)\b)\r\n                     Matches one of the given patterns\r\n              !\b!(\b(_\bp_\ba_\bt_\bt_\be_\br_\bn_\b-_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt)\b)\r\n                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns\r\n\r\n       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow, es\u2010\r\n       pecially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain\r\n       multiple  matches.   Using separate matches against shorter strings, or\r\n       using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.\r\n\r\n   Q\bQu\buo\bot\bte\be R\bRe\bem\bmo\bov\bva\bal\bl\r\n       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the charac\u2010\r\n       ters  \\\b\\,  '\b', and \"\b\" that did not result from one of the above expansions\r\n       are removed.\r\n\r\nR\bRE\bED\bDI\bIR\bRE\bEC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       Before a command is executed, its input and output  may  be  _\br_\be_\bd_\bi_\br_\be_\bc_\bt_\be_\bd\r\n       using  a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows\r\n       commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to  refer\r\n       to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and\r\n       writes to.  Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in  the\r\n       current  shell execution environment.  The following redirection opera\u2010\r\n       tors may precede or appear anywhere within a _\bs_\bi_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd or may fol\u2010\r\n       low  a  _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd.   Redirections are processed in the order they appear,\r\n       from left to right.\r\n\r\n       Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor  number  may\r\n       instead be preceded by a word of the form {_\bv_\ba_\br_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be}.  In this case, for\r\n       each redirection operator except >&- and <&-, the shell will allocate a\r\n       file  descriptor  greater than or equal to 10 and assign it to _\bv_\ba_\br_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.\r\n       If >&- or <&- is preceded by {_\bv_\ba_\br_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be}, the value  of  _\bv_\ba_\br_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be  defines\r\n       the  file descriptor to close.  If {_\bv_\ba_\br_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be} is supplied, the redirect\u2010\r\n       ion persists beyond the scope of the command, allowing the  shell  pro\u2010\r\n       grammer to manage the file descriptor himself.\r\n\r\n       In  the  following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omit\u2010\r\n       ted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <\b<, the  re\u2010\r\n       direction  refers  to  the  standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the\r\n       first character of the  redirection  operator  is  >\b>,  the  redirection\r\n       refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).\r\n\r\n       The  word  following the redirection operator in the following descrip\u2010\r\n       tions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace  expansion,  tilde\r\n       expansion,  parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command substitution,\r\n       arithmetic expansion,  quote  removal,  pathname  expansion,  and  word\r\n       splitting.  If it expands to more than one word, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh reports an error.\r\n\r\n       Note  that  the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the\r\n       command\r\n\r\n              ls >\b> dirlist 2>\b>&\b&1\r\n\r\n       directs both standard output and standard error to  the  file  _\bd_\bi_\br_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt,\r\n       while the command\r\n\r\n              ls 2>\b>&\b&1 >\b> dirlist\r\n\r\n       directs  only the standard output to file _\bd_\bi_\br_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt, because the standard\r\n       error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard  out\u2010\r\n       put was redirected to _\bd_\bi_\br_\bl_\bi_\bs_\bt.\r\n\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirec\u2010\r\n       tions, as described in the following table.  If the operating system on\r\n       which b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is running provides these special files, bash will use them;\r\n       otherwise it will emulate them internally with the  behavior  described\r\n       below.\r\n\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/f\bfd\bd/\b/_\bf_\bd\r\n                     If  _\bf_\bd  is  a valid integer, file descriptor _\bf_\bd is dupli\u2010\r\n                     cated.\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/s\bst\btd\bdi\bin\bn\r\n                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/s\bst\btd\bdo\bou\but\bt\r\n                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/s\bst\btd\bde\ber\brr\br\r\n                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/t\btc\bcp\bp/\b/_\bh_\bo_\bs_\bt/\b/_\bp_\bo_\br_\bt\r\n                     If _\bh_\bo_\bs_\bt is a valid hostname or Internet address, and _\bp_\bo_\br_\bt\r\n                     is  an integer port number or service name, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh attempts\r\n                     to open the corresponding TCP socket.\r\n              /\b/d\bde\bev\bv/\b/u\bud\bdp\bp/\b/_\bh_\bo_\bs_\bt/\b/_\bp_\bo_\br_\bt\r\n                     If _\bh_\bo_\bs_\bt is a valid hostname or Internet address, and _\bp_\bo_\br_\bt\r\n                     is  an integer port number or service name, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh attempts\r\n                     to open the corresponding UDP socket.\r\n\r\n       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.\r\n\r\n       Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used  with\r\n       care,  as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses inter\u2010\r\n       nally.\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bed\bdi\bir\bre\bec\bct\bti\bin\bng\bg I\bIn\bnp\bpu\but\bt\r\n       Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expan\u2010\r\n       sion  of  _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd  to  be  opened for reading on file descriptor _\bn, or the\r\n       standard input (file descriptor 0) if _\bn is not specified.\r\n\r\n       The general format for redirecting input is:\r\n\r\n              [_\bn]<\b<_\bw_\bo_\br_\bd\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bed\bdi\bir\bre\bec\bct\bti\bin\bng\bg O\bOu\but\btp\bpu\but\bt\r\n       Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from  the  ex\u2010\r\n       pansion  of  _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd to be opened for writing on file descriptor _\bn, or the\r\n       standard output (file descriptor 1) if _\bn is not specified.

The shell maintains a list of\r\n       aliases that may be set and unset with the a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs  and  u\bun\bna\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs  builtin\r\n       commands  (see  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL  B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).  The first word of each\r\n       simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.   If\r\n       so,  that word is replaced by the text of the alias.  The characters /\b/,\r\n       $\b$, `\b`, and =\b= and any of the shell _\bm_\be_\bt_\ba_\bc_\bh_\ba_\br_\ba_\bc_\bt_\be_\br_\bs or  quoting  characters\r\n       listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may\r\n       contain any valid shell input,  including  shell  metacharacters.   The\r\n       first  word  of  the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word\r\n       that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded  a  second\r\n       time.   This  means  that  one may alias l\bls\bs to l\bls\bs -\b-F\bF, for instance, and\r\n       b\bba\bas\bsh\bh does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.   If  the\r\n       last  character  of  the  alias value is a _\bb_\bl_\ba_\bn_\bk, then the next command\r\n       word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\r\n\r\n       Aliases are created and listed with the a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs command, and removed with\r\n       the u\bun\bna\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs command.\r\n\r\n       There  is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If\r\n       arguments are needed, a shell function should be  used  (see  F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS\r\n       below).\r\n\r\n       Aliases  are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the\r\n       e\bex\bxp\bpa\ban\bnd\bd_\b_a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bse\bes\bs shell option is set using s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt (see the description  of\r\n       s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt under S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).\r\n\r\n       The  rules  concerning  the  definition and use of aliases are somewhat\r\n       confusing.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh always reads at least one complete line of input,  and\r\n       all  lines that make up a compound command, before executing any of the\r\n       commands on that line or the compound command.   Aliases  are  expanded\r\n       when  a  command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias\r\n       definition appearing on the same line as another command does not  take\r\n       effect  until  the  next line of input is read.  The commands following\r\n       the alias definition on that line are not affected by  the  new  alias.\r\n       This  behavior  is  also an issue when functions are executed.  Aliases\r\n       are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the  function\r\n       is  executed,  because a function definition is itself a command.  As a\r\n       consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until  af\u2010\r\n       ter  that  function  is executed.  To be safe, always put alias defini\u2010\r\n       tions on a separate line, and do not use a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs in compound commands.\r\n\r\n       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\r\n\r\nF\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS\r\n       A shell function, defined  as  described  above  under  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL  G\bGR\bRA\bAM\bMM\bMA\bAR\bR,\r\n       stores  a  series  of commands for later execution.  When the name of a\r\n       shell function is used as a simple command name, the list  of  commands\r\n       associated with that function name is executed.  Functions are executed\r\n       in the context of the current shell; no new process is created  to  in\u2010\r\n       terpret  them  (contrast  this  with  the execution of a shell script).\r\n       When a function is executed, the arguments to the function  become  the\r\n       positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter #\b# is\r\n       updated to reflect the change.  Special parameter 0\b0 is unchanged.   The\r\n       first  element of the F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCN\bNA\bAM\bME\bE variable is set to the name of the func\u2010\r\n       tion while the function is executing.\r\n\r\n       All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical  be\u2010\r\n       tween  a  function  and its caller with these exceptions: the D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG and\r\n       R\bRE\bET\bTU\bUR\bRN\bN traps (see the description  of  the  t\btr\bra\bap\bp  builtin  under  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL\r\n       B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN  C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below) are not inherited unless the function has been\r\n       given the t\btr\bra\bac\bce\be attribute (see the description of the  d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be  builtin\r\n       below)  or  the -\b-o\bo f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\btr\bra\bac\bce\be shell option has been enabled with the s\bse\bet\bt\r\n       builtin (in which case all  functions  inherit  the  D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG  and  R\bRE\bET\bTU\bUR\bRN\bN\r\n       traps),  and the E\bER\bRR\bR trap is not inherited unless the -\b-o\bo e\ber\brr\brt\btr\bra\bac\bce\be shell\r\n       option has been enabled.\r\n\r\n       Variables local to the function may be declared with the l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl  builtin\r\n       command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the\r\n       function and its caller.  If a variable is declared  l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl,  the  vari\u2010\r\n       able's  visible  scope  is restricted to that function and its children\r\n       (including the functions it calls).  Local variables \"shadow\" variables\r\n       with  the same name declared at previous scopes.  For instance, a local\r\n       variable declared in a function hides a global  variable  of  the  same\r\n       name:  references  and assignments refer to the local variable, leaving\r\n       the global variable unmodified.  When the function returns, the  global\r\n       variable is once again visible.\r\n\r\n       The  shell  uses  _\bd_\by_\bn_\ba_\bm_\bi_\bc  _\bs_\bc_\bo_\bp_\bi_\bn_\bg  to  control a variable's visibility\r\n       within functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible  variables  and  their\r\n       values  are a result of the sequence of function calls that caused exe\u2010\r\n       cution to reach the current function.  The value of a variable  that  a\r\n       function  sees  depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether\r\n       that caller is the \"global\" scope or another shell function.   This  is\r\n       also  the  value  that  a local variable declaration \"shadows\", and the\r\n       value that is restored when the function returns.\r\n\r\n       For example, if a variable _\bv_\ba_\br is declared as local in function  _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\b1,\r\n       and  _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\b1  calls  another  function _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\b2, references to _\bv_\ba_\br made from\r\n       within _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\b2 will resolve to the local variable _\bv_\ba_\br from _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\b1, shadow\u2010\r\n       ing any global variable named _\bv_\ba_\br.\r\n\r\n       The u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable\r\n       is local to the current scope, u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt will unset it; otherwise the unset\r\n       will  refer  to  the  variable  found in any calling scope as described\r\n       above.  If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will  re\u2010\r\n       main  so until it is reset in that scope or until the function returns.\r\n       Once the function returns, any instance of the variable at  a  previous\r\n       scope will become visible.  If the unset acts on a variable at a previ\u2010\r\n       ous scope, any instance of a variable with  that  name  that  had  been\r\n       shadowed will become visible.\r\n\r\n       The  F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCN\bNE\bES\bST\bT  variable,  if set to a numeric value greater than 0, de\u2010\r\n       fines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that  ex\u2010\r\n       ceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.\r\n\r\n       If  the  builtin command r\bre\bet\btu\bur\brn\bn is executed in a function, the function\r\n       completes and execution resumes with the next command after  the  func\u2010\r\n       tion call.  Any command associated with the R\bRE\bET\bTU\bUR\bRN\bN trap is executed be\u2010\r\n       fore execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values  of  the\r\n       positional  parameters  and the special parameter #\b# are restored to the\r\n       values they had prior to the function's execution.\r\n\r\n       Function names and definitions may be listed with the -\b-f\bf option to  the\r\n       d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be or t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt builtin commands.  The -\b-F\bF option to d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be or t\bty\byp\bpe\be\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       s\bse\bet\bt will list the function names only (and optionally the  source  file\r\n       and  line  number, if the e\bex\bxt\btd\bde\beb\bbu\bug\bg shell option is enabled).  Functions\r\n       may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined  with\r\n       the  -\b-f\bf  option  to  the  e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt builtin.  A function definition may be\r\n       deleted using the -\b-f\bf option to the u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt builtin.\r\n\r\n       Functions may be recursive.  The F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCN\bNE\bES\bST\bT variable may be used to limit\r\n       the  depth  of the function call stack and restrict the number of func\u2010\r\n       tion invocations.  By default, no limit is imposed on the number of re\u2010\r\n       cursive calls.\r\n\r\nA\bAR\bRI\bIT\bTH\bHM\bME\bET\bTI\bIC\bC E\bEV\bVA\bAL\bLU\bUA\bAT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       The  shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain\r\n       circumstances (see the l\ble\bet\bt and d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be builtin commands,  the  (\b((\b(  com\u2010\r\n       pound command, and A\bAr\bri\bit\bth\bhm\bme\bet\bti\bic\bc E\bEx\bxp\bpa\ban\bns\bsi\bio\bon\bn).

Within an expression, shell\r\n       variables may also be referenced by name without  using  the  parameter\r\n       expansion  syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to\r\n       0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.\r\n       The  value  of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when\r\n       it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given  the  _\bi_\bn_\bt_\be_\bg_\be_\br\r\n       attribute using d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be -\b-i\bi is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates\r\n       to 0.  A shell variable need not have its _\bi_\bn_\bt_\be_\bg_\be_\br attribute  turned  on\r\n       to be used in an expression.\r\n\r\n       Integer constants follow the C language definition, without suffixes or\r\n       character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as oc\u2010\r\n       tal  numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, num\u2010\r\n       bers take the form [_\bb_\ba_\bs_\be_\b#]n, where the optional _\bb_\ba_\bs_\be is a decimal  num\u2010\r\n       ber  between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and _\bn is a num\u2010\r\n       ber in that base.  If _\bb_\ba_\bs_\be_\b# is omitted, then base  10  is  used.   When\r\n       specifying _\bn, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9 are\r\n       represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and  _,\r\n       in  that order.  If _\bb_\ba_\bs_\be is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and up\u2010\r\n       percase letters may be used interchangeably to  represent  numbers  be\u2010\r\n       tween 10 and 35.\r\n\r\n       Operators  are  evaluated  in  order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in\r\n       parentheses are evaluated first and may override the  precedence  rules\r\n       above.\r\n\r\nC\bCO\bON\bND\bDI\bIT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNA\bAL\bL E\bEX\bXP\bPR\bRE\bES\bSS\bSI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS\r\n       Conditional  expressions  are  used  by the [\b[[\b[ compound command and the\r\n       t\bte\bes\bst\bt and [\b[ builtin commands to test file attributes and perform  string\r\n       and  arithmetic  comparisons.   The t\bte\bes\bst\bt and [\b[ commands determine their\r\n       behavior based on the number of  arguments;  see  the  descriptions  of\r\n       those commands for any other command-specific actions.\r\n\r\n       Expressions  are  formed  from the following unary or binary primaries.\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh handles several filenames specially when they are used in  expres\u2010\r\n       sions.

When used with the [\b[[\b[ command, _\bA_\br_\bg_\b1 and\r\n              _\bA_\br_\bg_\b2 are evaluated as  arithmetic  expressions  (see  A\bAR\bRI\bIT\bTH\bHM\bME\bET\bTI\bIC\bC\r\n              E\bEV\bVA\bAL\bLU\bUA\bAT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN above).\r\n\r\nS\bSI\bIM\bMP\bPL\bLE\bE C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bD E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following ex\u2010\r\n       pansions, assignments, and redirections, from left  to  right,  in  the\r\n       following order.\r\n\r\n       1.     The  words  that  the  parser has marked as variable assignments\r\n              (those preceding the command name) and  redirections  are  saved\r\n              for later processing.\r\n\r\n       2.     The  words that are not variable assignments or redirections are\r\n              expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the  first  word\r\n              is  taken  to be the name of the command and the remaining words\r\n              are the arguments.\r\n\r\n       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under R\bRE\bED\bDI\bIR\bRE\bEC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN.\r\n\r\n       4.     The text after the =\b= in each variable assignment undergoes tilde\r\n              expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic\r\n              expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the  vari\u2010\r\n              able.\r\n\r\n       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current\r\n       shell environment.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the  environ\u2010\r\n       ment  of the executed command and do not affect the current shell envi\u2010\r\n       ronment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign  a  value  to  a\r\n       readonly  variable,  an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-\r\n       zero status.\r\n\r\n       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not  af\u2010\r\n       fect  the  current  shell  environment.  A redirection error causes the\r\n       command to exit with a non-zero status.\r\n\r\n       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds  as\r\n       described  below.   Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of the expan\u2010\r\n       sions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the  command\r\n       is  the  exit  status  of  the last command substitution performed.  If\r\n       there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of\r\n       zero.\r\n\r\nC\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bD E\bEX\bXE\bEC\bCU\bUT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       After  a  command  has been split into words, if it results in a simple\r\n       command and an optional list of arguments, the  following  actions  are\r\n       taken.\r\n\r\n       If  the  command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate\r\n       it.  If there exists a shell function by that name,  that  function  is\r\n       invoked  as described above in F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS.  If the name does not match a\r\n       function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.   If\r\n       a match is found, that builtin is invoked.\r\n\r\n       If  the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no\r\n       slashes, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh searches each element of the P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH for  a  directory  con\u2010\r\n       taining an executable file by that name.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh uses a hash table to re\u2010\r\n       member the full pathnames of executable files  (see  h\bha\bas\bsh\bh  under  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL\r\n       B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN  C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS  below).  A full search of the directories in P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH is\r\n       performed only if the command is not found in the hash table.   If  the\r\n       search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function\r\n       named c\bco\bom\bmm\bma\ban\bnd\bd_\b_n\bno\bot\bt_\b_f\bfo\bou\bun\bnd\bd_\b_h\bha\ban\bnd\bdl\ble\be.  If that function exists, it is invoked\r\n       in  a  separate execution environment with the original command and the\r\n       original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's  exit\r\n       status  becomes  the exit status of that subshell.  If that function is\r\n       not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit sta\u2010\r\n       tus of 127.\r\n\r\n       If  the  search  is  successful, or if the command name contains one or\r\n       more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execu\u2010\r\n       tion environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remain\u2010\r\n       ing arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.\r\n\r\n       If this execution fails because the file is not in  executable  format,\r\n       and  the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl _\bs_\bc_\br_\bi_\bp_\bt, a\r\n       file containing shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to  execute  it.\r\n       This  subshell  reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new\r\n       shell had been invoked to handle the script, with  the  exception  that\r\n       the  locations of commands remembered by the parent (see h\bha\bas\bsh\bh below un\u2010\r\n       der S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS) are retained by the child.\r\n\r\n       If the program is a file beginning with #\b#!\b!, the remainder of the  first\r\n       line  specifies an interpreter for the program.

Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also\r\n       executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell envi\u2010\r\n       ronment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.\r\n\r\n       Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of\r\n       the -\b-e\be option from the parent shell.  When  not  in  _\bp_\bo_\bs_\bi_\bx  _\bm_\bo_\bd_\be,  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh\r\n       clears the -\b-e\be option in such subshells.\r\n\r\n       If  a command is followed by a &\b& and job control is not active, the de\u2010\r\n       fault standard input for the command is the empty file _\b/_\bd_\be_\bv_\b/_\bn_\bu_\bl_\bl.  Oth\u2010\r\n       erwise,  the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the call\u2010\r\n       ing shell as modified by redirections.\r\n\r\nE\bEN\bNV\bVI\bIR\bRO\bON\bNM\bME\bEN\bNT\bT\r\n       When a program is invoked it is given an array of  strings  called  the\r\n       _\be_\bn_\bv_\bi_\br_\bo_\bn_\bm_\be_\bn_\bt.   This  is  a  list  of  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be-_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be  pairs,  of  the  form\r\n       _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be.\r\n\r\n       The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On  in\u2010\r\n       vocation,  the  shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter\r\n       for each name found, automatically marking it for _\be_\bx_\bp_\bo_\br_\bt to child  pro\u2010\r\n       cesses.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt and d\bde\be\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       c\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be -\b-x\bx commands allow parameters and functions to  be  added  to  and\r\n       deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the envi\u2010\r\n       ronment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, re\u2010\r\n       placing  the  old.   The  environment inherited by any executed command\r\n       consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be  modi\u2010\r\n       fied  in  the  shell, less any pairs removed by the u\bun\bns\bse\bet\bt command, plus\r\n       any additions via the e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt and d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be -\b-x\bx commands.\r\n\r\n       The environment for any _\bs_\bi_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd or  function  may  be  augmented\r\n       temporarily  by  prefixing  it with parameter assignments, as described\r\n       above in P\bPA\bAR\bRA\bAM\bME\bET\bTE\bER\bRS\bS.  These assignment statements affect only the envi\u2010\r\n       ronment seen by that command.\r\n\r\n       If  the  -\b-k\bk option is set (see the s\bse\bet\bt builtin command below), then _\ba_\bl_\bl\r\n       parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command,  not\r\n       just those that precede the command name.\r\n\r\n       When  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  invokes  an  external command, the variable _\b_ is set to the\r\n       full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environ\u2010\r\n       ment.\r\n\r\nE\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT S\bST\bTA\bAT\bTU\bUS\bS\r\n       The  exit  status  of  an executed command is the value returned by the\r\n       _\bw_\ba_\bi_\bt_\bp_\bi_\bd system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between\r\n       0  and  255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above\r\n       125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands\r\n       are also limited to this range.  Under certain circumstances, the shell\r\n       will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.\r\n\r\n       For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status\r\n       has  succeeded.   An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero\r\n       exit status indicates failure.  When a command terminates  on  a  fatal\r\n       signal _\bN, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh uses the value of 128+_\bN as the exit status.\r\n\r\n       If  a command is not found, the child process created to execute it re\u2010\r\n       turns a status of 127.  If a command is found but  is  not  executable,\r\n       the return status is 126.\r\n\r\n       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,\r\n       the exit status is greater than zero.\r\n\r\n       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (_\bt_\br_\bu_\be) if  successful,  and\r\n       non-zero  (_\bf_\ba_\bl_\bs_\be)  if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins\r\n       return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage,  generally  in\u2010\r\n       valid options or missing arguments.\r\n\r\n       B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh  itself  returns the exit status of the last command executed, un\u2010\r\n       less a syntax error occurs, in which case  it  exits  with  a  non-zero\r\n       value.  See also the e\bex\bxi\bit\bt builtin command below.\r\n\r\nS\bSI\bIG\bGN\bNA\bAL\bLS\bS\r\n       When  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  is  interactive,  in  the  absence of any traps, it ignores\r\n       S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTE\bER\bRM\bM (so that k\bki\bil\bll\bl 0\b0 does not kill an interactive shell), and S\bSI\bIG\bGI\bIN\bNT\bT\r\n       is  caught and handled (so that the w\bwa\bai\bit\bt builtin is interruptible).  In\r\n       all cases, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh ignores S\bSI\bIG\bGQ\bQU\bUI\bIT\bT.  If job control is in effect, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh ig\u2010\r\n       nores S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTT\bTI\bIN\bN, S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTT\bTO\bOU\bU, and S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTS\bST\bTP\bP.\r\n\r\n       Non-builtin commands run by b\bba\bas\bsh\bh have signal handlers set to the values\r\n       inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job control is not in ef\u2010\r\n       fect,  asynchronous  commands  ignore S\bSI\bIG\bGI\bIN\bNT\bT and S\bSI\bIG\bGQ\bQU\bUI\bIT\bT in addition to\r\n       these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command  substi\u2010\r\n       tution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTT\bTI\bIN\bN, S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bT\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       T\bTO\bOU\bU, and S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTS\bST\bTP\bP.\r\n\r\n       The shell exits by default upon receipt of a S\bSI\bIG\bGH\bHU\bUP\bP.   Before  exiting,\r\n       an  interactive  shell  resends  the  S\bSI\bIG\bGH\bHU\bUP\bP  to  all  jobs, running or\r\n       stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent S\bSI\bIG\bGC\bCO\bON\bNT\bT to ensure that they receive the\r\n       S\bSI\bIG\bGH\bHU\bUP\bP.   To  prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular\r\n       job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the  d\bdi\bis\bso\bow\bwn\bn  builtin\r\n       (see  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below) or marked to not receive S\bSI\bIG\bGH\bHU\bUP\bP us\u2010\r\n       ing d\bdi\bis\bso\bow\bwn\bn -\b-h\bh.\r\n\r\n       If the h\bhu\bup\bpo\bon\bne\bex\bxi\bit\bt shell option has been set with  s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt,  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh  sends  a\r\n       S\bSI\bIG\bGH\bHU\bUP\bP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.\r\n\r\n       If  b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for\r\n       which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the com\u2010\r\n       mand  completes.   When b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is waiting for an asynchronous command via\r\n       the w\bwa\bai\bit\bt builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap  has  been\r\n       set will cause the w\bwa\bai\bit\bt builtin to return immediately with an exit sta\u2010\r\n       tus greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.\r\n\r\nJ\bJO\bOB\bB C\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL\r\n       _\bJ_\bo_\bb _\bc_\bo_\bn_\bt_\br_\bo_\bl refers to the ability to selectively stop (_\bs_\bu_\bs_\bp_\be_\bn_\bd) the ex\u2010\r\n       ecution  of  processes and continue (_\br_\be_\bs_\bu_\bm_\be) their execution at a later\r\n       point.  A user typically employs this facility via an  interactive  in\u2010\r\n       terface  supplied  jointly  by  the  operating system kernel's terminal\r\n       driver and b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.\r\n\r\n       The shell associates a _\bj_\bo_\bb with each pipeline.  It  keeps  a  table  of\r\n       currently  executing  jobs,  which may be listed with the j\bjo\bob\bbs\bs command.\r\n       When b\bba\bas\bsh\bh starts a job asynchronously (in the _\bb_\ba_\bc_\bk_\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd), it prints  a\r\n       line that looks like:\r\n\r\n              [1] 25647\r\n\r\n       indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the\r\n       last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of\r\n       the  processes  in a single pipeline are members of the same job.  B\bBa\bas\bsh\bh\r\n       uses the _\bj_\bo_\bb abstraction as the basis for job control.\r\n\r\n       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job  control,\r\n       the operating system maintains the notion of a _\bc_\bu_\br_\br_\be_\bn_\bt _\bt_\be_\br_\bm_\bi_\bn_\ba_\bl _\bp_\br_\bo_\bc_\be_\bs_\bs\r\n       _\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bp _\bI_\bD.  Members of this process group (processes whose process group\r\n       ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-\r\n       generated signals such as S\bSI\bIG\bGI\bIN\bNT\bT.  These processes are said  to  be  in\r\n       the  _\bf_\bo_\br_\be_\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd.  _\bB_\ba_\bc_\bk_\bg_\br_\bo_\bu_\bn_\bd processes are those whose process group ID\r\n       differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-gen\u2010\r\n       erated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or,\r\n       if the user so specifies with  stty  tostop,  write  to  the  terminal.\r\n       Background  processes  which  attempt  to read from (write to when stty\r\n       tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTT\bTI\bIN\bN  (\b(S\bSI\bIG\bGT\bTT\bTO\bOU\bU)\b)  signal\r\n       by  the  kernel's  terminal  driver, which, unless caught, suspends the\r\n       process.\r\n\r\n       If the operating system on which b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is running supports job  control,\r\n       b\bba\bas\bsh\bh contains facilities to use it.  Typing the _\bs_\bu_\bs_\bp_\be_\bn_\bd character (typ\u2010\r\n       ically ^\b^Z\bZ, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to\r\n       be  stopped  and  returns  control to b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.  Typing the _\bd_\be_\bl_\ba_\by_\be_\bd _\bs_\bu_\bs_\bp_\be_\bn_\bd\r\n       character (typically ^\b^Y\bY, Control-Y) causes the process  to  be  stopped\r\n       when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be re\u2010\r\n       turned to b\bba\bas\bsh\bh.  The user may then manipulate the state  of  this  job,\r\n       using  the  b\bbg\bg command to continue it in the background, the f\bfg\bg command\r\n       to continue it in the foreground, or the k\bki\bil\bll\bl command to kill it.  A ^\b^Z\bZ\r\n       takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing\r\n       pending output and typeahead to be discarded.\r\n\r\n       There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The charac\u2010\r\n       ter  %\b%  introduces  a job specification (_\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc).  Job number _\bn may be\r\n       referred to as %\b%n\bn.  A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the\r\n       name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command\r\n       line.  For example, %\b%c\bce\be refers to a stopped job whose command name  be\u2010\r\n       gins  with  c\bce\be.  If a prefix matches more than one job, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh reports an\r\n       error.  Using %\b%?\b?c\bce\be, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the\r\n       string  c\bce\be in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one\r\n       job, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh reports an error.  The symbols %\b%%\b% and %\b%+\b+ refer to the shell's\r\n       notion  of  the _\bc_\bu_\br_\br_\be_\bn_\bt _\bj_\bo_\bb, which is the last job stopped while it was\r\n       in the foreground or started in the background.  The _\bp_\br_\be_\bv_\bi_\bo_\bu_\bs  _\bj_\bo_\bb  may\r\n       be  referenced  using %\b%-\b-.  If there is only a single job, %\b%+\b+ and %\b%-\b- can\r\n       both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g.,\r\n       the output of the j\bjo\bob\bbs\bs command), the current job is always flagged with\r\n       a +\b+, and the previous job with a -\b-.  A single % (with  no  accompanying\r\n       job specification) also refers to the current job.\r\n\r\n       Simply  naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %\b%1\b1 is\r\n       a synonym for `\b``\b`f\bfg\bg %\b%1\b1'\b''\b', bringing job 1 from the  background  into  the\r\n       foreground.   Similarly,  `\b``\b`%\b%1\b1  &\b&'\b''\b'  resumes  job  1 in the background,\r\n       equivalent to `\b``\b`b\bbg\bg %\b%1\b1'\b''\b'.\r\n\r\n       The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes  state.   Normally,\r\n       b\bba\bas\bsh\bh waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes\r\n       in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.  If  the  -\b-b\bb\r\n       option to the s\bse\bet\bt builtin command is enabled, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh reports such changes\r\n       immediately.  Any trap on S\bSI\bIG\bGC\bCH\bHL\bLD\bD is executed for each child  that  ex\u2010\r\n       its.\r\n\r\n       If  an  attempt to exit b\bba\bas\bsh\bh is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the\r\n       c\bch\bhe\bec\bck\bkj\bjo\bob\bbs\bs shell option has been enabled using the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt  builtin,  run\u2010\r\n       ning), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the c\bch\bhe\bec\bck\bkj\bjo\bob\bbs\bs option\r\n       is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.  The  j\bjo\bob\bbs\bs  command  may\r\n       then  be  used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt to exit is\r\n       made without an intervening command, the shell does not  print  another\r\n       warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.\r\n\r\n       When  the shell is waiting for a job or process using the w\bwa\bai\bit\bt builtin,\r\n       and job control is enabled, w\bwa\bai\bit\bt  will  return  when  the  job  changes\r\n       state.  The -\b-f\bf option causes w\bwa\bai\bit\bt to wait until the job or process ter\u2010\r\n       minates before returning.\r\n\r\nP\bPR\bRO\bOM\bMP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bNG\bG\r\n       When executing interactively, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh displays the primary prompt P\bPS\bS1\b1 when\r\n       it  is  ready  to  read a command, and the secondary prompt P\bPS\bS2\b2 when it\r\n       needs more input to complete a command.

A\r\n       vi-style line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be\r\n       enabled at any time using the -\b-o\bo e\bem\bma\bac\bcs\bs or -\b-o\bo  v\bvi\bi  options  to  the  s\bse\bet\bt\r\n       builtin  (see  S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below).  To turn off line editing\r\n       after the shell is running, use the +\b+o\bo e\bem\bma\bac\bcs\bs or +\b+o\bo v\bvi\bi  options  to  the\r\n       s\bse\bet\bt builtin.\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be N\bNo\bot\bta\bat\bti\bio\bon\bn\r\n       In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.\r\n       Control keys are denoted by C-_\bk_\be_\by, e.g., C-n  means  Control-N.   Simi\u2010\r\n       larly,  _\bm_\be_\bt_\ba  keys are denoted by M-_\bk_\be_\by, so M-x means Meta-X.  (On key\u2010\r\n       boards without a _\bm_\be_\bt_\ba key, M-_\bx means ESC _\bx, i.e., press the Escape  key\r\n       then the _\bx key.  This makes ESC the _\bm_\be_\bt_\ba _\bp_\br_\be_\bf_\bi_\bx.  The combination M-C-_\bx\r\n       means ESC-Control-_\bx, or press the Escape key then hold the Control  key\r\n       while pressing the _\bx key.)\r\n\r\n       Readline commands may be given numeric _\ba_\br_\bg_\bu_\bm_\be_\bn_\bt_\bs, which normally act as\r\n       a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the  sign  of  the  argument\r\n       that  is  significant.   Passing  a negative argument to a command that\r\n       acts in the forward direction (e.g., k\bki\bil\bll\bl-\b-l\bli\bin\bne\be) causes that command  to\r\n       act  in  a  backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments\r\n       deviates from this are noted below.\r\n\r\n       When a command is described as _\bk_\bi_\bl_\bl_\bi_\bn_\bg text, the text deleted is  saved\r\n       for possible future retrieval (_\by_\ba_\bn_\bk_\bi_\bn_\bg).  The killed text is saved in a\r\n       _\bk_\bi_\bl_\bl _\br_\bi_\bn_\bg.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one\r\n       unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text\r\n       separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be I\bIn\bni\bit\bti\bia\bal\bli\biz\bza\bat\bti\bio\bon\bn\r\n       Readline is customized by putting commands in  an  initialization  file\r\n       (the  _\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc  file).  The name of this file is taken from the value of\r\n       the I\bIN\bNP\bPU\bUT\bTR\bRC\bC variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is _\b~_\b/_\b._\bi_\bn_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc.   If  that  file  does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate\r\n       default is _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc.  When a program which uses  the  readline  li\u2010\r\n       brary  starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key bindings\r\n       and variables are set.  There are only a few basic  constructs  allowed\r\n       in  the  readline initialization file.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines\r\n       beginning with a #\b# are comments.  Lines beginning  with  a  $\b$  indicate\r\n       conditional  constructs.   Other lines denote key bindings and variable\r\n       settings.\r\n\r\n       The default key-bindings may be changed with an  _\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc  file.   Other\r\n       programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.\r\n\r\n       For example, placing\r\n\r\n              M-Control-u: universal-argument\r\n       or\r\n              C-Meta-u: universal-argument\r\n       into  the _\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc would make M-C-u execute the readline command _\bu_\bn_\bi_\bv_\be_\br_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bs_\ba_\bl_\b-_\ba_\br_\bg_\bu_\bm_\be_\bn_\bt.\r\n\r\n       The following symbolic character names  are  recognized:  _\bR_\bU_\bB_\bO_\bU_\bT,  _\bD_\bE_\bL,\r\n       _\bE_\bS_\bC, _\bL_\bF_\bD, _\bN_\bE_\bW_\bL_\bI_\bN_\bE, _\bR_\bE_\bT, _\bR_\bE_\bT_\bU_\bR_\bN, _\bS_\bP_\bC, _\bS_\bP_\bA_\bC_\bE, and _\bT_\bA_\bB.\r\n\r\n       In  addition  to  command  names, readline allows keys to be bound to a\r\n       string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a _\bm_\ba_\bc_\br_\bo).\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be K\bKe\bey\by B\bBi\bin\bnd\bdi\bin\bng\bgs\bs\r\n       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the _\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc file is  simple.\r\n       All  that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro\r\n       and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The name may be speci\u2010\r\n       fied in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with _\bM_\be_\bt_\ba_\b- or\r\n       _\bC_\bo_\bn_\bt_\br_\bo_\bl_\b- prefixes, or as a key sequence.\r\n\r\n       When using the form k\bke\bey\byn\bna\bam\bme\be:_\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\b-_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be or _\bm_\ba_\bc_\br_\bo, _\bk_\be_\by_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is the name\r\n       of a key spelled out in English.  For example:\r\n\r\n              Control-u: universal-argument\r\n              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word\r\n              Control-o: \"> output\"\r\n\r\n       In  the above example, _\bC_\b-_\bu is bound to the function u\bun\bni\biv\bve\ber\brs\bsa\bal\bl-\b-a\bar\brg\bgu\bum\bme\ben\bnt\bt,\r\n       _\bM_\b-_\bD_\bE_\bL is bound to the function b\bba\bac\bck\bkw\bwa\bar\brd\bd-\b-k\bki\bil\bll\bl-\b-w\bwo\bor\brd\bd, and _\bC_\b-_\bo is bound  to\r\n       run  the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the\r\n       text ``> output'' into the line).\r\n\r\n       In the second form, \"\b\"k\bke\bey\bys\bse\beq\bq\"\b\":_\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\b-_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be  or  _\bm_\ba_\bc_\br_\bo,  k\bke\bey\bys\bse\beq\bq  differs\r\n       from  k\bke\bey\byn\bna\bam\bme\be above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may\r\n       be specified by placing the sequence within double  quotes.   Some  GNU\r\n       Emacs  style  key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but\r\n       the symbolic character names are not recognized.\r\n\r\n              \"\\C-u\": universal-argument\r\n              \"\\C-x\\C-r\": re-read-init-file\r\n              \"\\e[11~\": \"Function Key 1\"\r\n\r\n       In this example, _\bC_\b-_\bu is again bound to the function u\bun\bni\biv\bve\ber\brs\bsa\bal\bl-\b-a\bar\brg\bgu\bum\bme\ben\bnt\bt.\r\n       _\bC_\b-_\bx  _\bC_\b-_\br is bound to the function r\bre\be-\b-r\bre\bea\bad\bd-\b-i\bin\bni\bit\bt-\b-f\bfi\bil\ble\be, and _\bE_\bS_\bC _\b[ _\b1 _\b1 _\b~ is\r\n       bound to insert the text ``Function Key 1''.\r\n\r\n       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is\r\n              \\\b\\C\bC-\b-    control prefix\r\n              \\\b\\M\bM-\b-    meta prefix\r\n              \\\b\\e\be     an escape character\r\n              \\\b\\\\\b\\     backslash\r\n              \\\b\\\"\b\"     literal \"\r\n              \\\b\\'\b'     literal '\r\n\r\n       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a  second  set  of\r\n       backslash escapes is available:\r\n              \\\b\\a\ba     alert (bell)\r\n              \\\b\\b\bb     backspace\r\n              \\\b\\d\bd     delete\r\n              \\\b\\f\bf     form feed\r\n              \\\b\\n\bn     newline\r\n              \\\b\\r\br     carriage return\r\n              \\\b\\t\bt     horizontal tab\r\n              \\\b\\v\bv     vertical tab\r\n              \\\b\\_\bn_\bn_\bn   the  eight-bit  character  whose value is the octal value\r\n                     _\bn_\bn_\bn (one to three digits)\r\n              \\\b\\x\bx_\bH_\bH   the eight-bit character whose value  is  the  hexadecimal\r\n                     value _\bH_\bH (one or two hex digits)\r\n\r\n       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used\r\n       to indicate a macro definition.

There\r\n       are four parser directives used.\r\n\r\n       $\b$i\bif\bf    The $\b$i\bif\bf construct allows bindings to be made based on the  edit\u2010\r\n              ing  mode,  the  terminal  being  used, or the application using\r\n              readline.  The text of the test, after any comparison operator,\r\n               extends to the end of the  line;  unless  otherwise  noted,  no\r\n              characters are required to isolate it.\r\n\r\n              m\bmo\bod\bde\be   The  m\bmo\bod\bde\be=\b=  form  of  the  $\b$i\bif\bf  directive is used to test\r\n                     whether readline is in emacs or vi  mode.   This  may  be\r\n                     used  in conjunction with the s\bse\bet\bt k\bke\bey\bym\bma\bap\bp command, for in\u2010\r\n                     stance,  to  set  bindings  in  the  _\be_\bm_\ba_\bc_\bs_\b-_\bs_\bt_\ba_\bn_\bd_\ba_\br_\bd   and\r\n                     _\be_\bm_\ba_\bc_\bs_\b-_\bc_\bt_\bl_\bx  keymaps  only  if readline is starting out in\r\n                     emacs mode.\r\n\r\n              t\bte\ber\brm\bm   The t\bte\ber\brm\bm=\b= form may be used to  include  terminal-specific\r\n                     key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by\r\n                     the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side\r\n                     of the =\b= is tested against both the full name of the ter\u2010\r\n                     minal and the portion of the  terminal  name  before  the\r\n                     first  -\b-.  This allows _\bs_\bu_\bn to match both _\bs_\bu_\bn and _\bs_\bu_\bn_\b-_\bc_\bm_\bd,\r\n                     for instance.\r\n\r\n              v\bve\ber\brs\bsi\bio\bon\bn\r\n                     The v\bve\ber\brs\bsi\bio\bon\bn test  may  be  used  to  perform  comparisons\r\n                     against  specific readline versions.  The v\bve\ber\brs\bsi\bio\bon\bn expands\r\n                     to the current readline version.  The set  of  comparison\r\n                     operators  includes  =\b=,  (and  =\b==\b=), !\b!=\b=, <\b<=\b=, >\b>=\b=, <\b<, and >\b>.\r\n                     The version number supplied on the right side of the  op\u2010\r\n                     erator  consists  of  a major version number, an optional\r\n                     decimal point, and an optional minor version (e.g., 7\b7.\b.1\b1).\r\n                     If  the  minor version is omitted, it is assumed to be 0\b0.\r\n                     The operator may be separated from the string v\bve\ber\brs\bsi\bio\bon\bn and\r\n                     from the version number argument by whitespace.\r\n\r\n              a\bap\bpp\bpl\bli\bic\bca\bat\bti\bio\bon\bn\r\n                     The a\bap\bpp\bpl\bli\bic\bca\bat\bti\bio\bon\bn construct is used to include application-\r\n                     specific settings.  Each program using the  readline  li\u2010\r\n                     brary  sets  the  _\ba_\bp_\bp_\bl_\bi_\bc_\ba_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, and an initialization\r\n                     file can test for a particular value.  This could be used\r\n                     to  bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific\r\n                     program.  For instance, the following command adds a  key\r\n                     sequence  that  quotes  the  current  or previous word in\r\n                     b\bba\bas\bsh\bh:\r\n\r\n                     $\b$i\bif\bf Bash\r\n                     # Quote the current or previous word\r\n                     \"\\C-xq\": \"\\eb\\\"\\ef\\\"\"\r\n                     $\b$e\ben\bnd\bdi\bif\bf\r\n\r\n              _\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be\r\n                     The _\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be construct provides simple equality tests for\r\n                     readline  variables and values.  The permitted comparison\r\n                     operators are _\b=, _\b=_\b=, and _\b!_\b=.  The variable name  must  be\r\n                     separated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the\r\n                     operator may be separated from the  value  on  the  right\r\n                     hand  side  by whitespace.  Both string and boolean vari\u2010\r\n                     ables may be tested. Boolean  variables  must  be  tested\r\n                     against the values _\bo_\bn and _\bo_\bf_\bf.\r\n\r\n       $\b$e\ben\bnd\bdi\bif\bf This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $\b$i\bif\bf\r\n              command.\r\n\r\n       $\b$e\bel\bls\bse\be  Commands in this branch of the $\b$i\bif\bf directive are executed if the\r\n              test fails.\r\n\r\n       $\b$i\bin\bnc\bcl\blu\bud\bde\be\r\n              This  directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads\r\n              commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the  follow\u2010\r\n              ing directive would read _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc:\r\n\r\n              $\b$i\bin\bnc\bcl\blu\bud\bde\be  _\b/_\be_\bt_\bc_\b/_\bi_\bn_\bp_\bu_\bt_\br_\bc\r\n\r\n   S\bSe\bea\bar\brc\bch\bhi\bin\bng\bg\r\n       Readline  provides  commands  for searching through the command history\r\n       (see H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY below) for lines containing a specified string.  There are\r\n       two search modes: _\bi_\bn_\bc_\br_\be_\bm_\be_\bn_\bt_\ba_\bl and _\bn_\bo_\bn_\b-_\bi_\bn_\bc_\br_\be_\bm_\be_\bn_\bt_\ba_\bl.\r\n\r\n       Incremental  searches  begin  before  the  user has finished typing the\r\n       search string.  As each character of the search string is typed,  read\u2010\r\n       line displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed\r\n       so far.  An incremental search requires  only  as  many  characters  as\r\n       needed  to  find  the desired history entry.  The characters present in\r\n       the value of the i\bis\bse\bea\bar\brc\bch\bh-\b-t\bte\ber\brm\bmi\bin\bna\bat\bto\bor\brs\bs variable are used to terminate  an\r\n       incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the\r\n       Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an  incremental  search.\r\n       Control-G  will  abort  an  incremental search and restore the original\r\n       line.  When the search is terminated, the history entry containing  the\r\n       search string becomes the current line.\r\n\r\n       To  find  other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or\r\n       Control-R as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in  the\r\n       history  for  the  next  entry matching the search string typed so far.\r\n       Any other key sequence bound to a readline command will  terminate  the\r\n       search  and  execute that command.  For instance, a _\bn_\be_\bw_\bl_\bi_\bn_\be will termi\u2010\r\n       nate the search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from\r\n       the history list.\r\n\r\n       Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two Control-\r\n       Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a  new  search\r\n       string, any remembered search string is used.\r\n\r\n       Non-incremental  searches read the entire search string before starting\r\n       to search for matching history lines.  The search string may  be  typed\r\n       by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.\r\n\r\n   R\bRe\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be C\bCo\bom\bmm\bma\ban\bnd\bd N\bNa\bam\bme\bes\bs\r\n       The  following  is  a list of the names of the commands and the default\r\n       key sequences to which they are bound.

The  default  value  of  c\bco\bom\bmm\bme\ben\bnt\bt-\b-b\bbe\beg\bgi\bin\bn\r\n              causes  this  command  to make the current line a shell comment.\r\n              If a numeric argument causes the comment  character  to  be  re\u2010\r\n              moved, the line will be executed by the shell.\r\n       g\bgl\blo\bob\bb-\b-c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be-\b-w\bwo\bor\brd\bd (\b(M\bM-\b-g\bg)\b)\r\n              The  word  before point is treated as a pattern for pathname ex\u2010\r\n              pansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended.

If  the  command  word  is  the\r\n       empty  string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line),\r\n       any compspec defined with the -\b-E\bE option to  c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be  is  used.   If  a\r\n       compspec  has  been  defined  for that command, the compspec is used to\r\n       generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the command\r\n       word  is  a full pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched\r\n       for first.  If no compspec is found for the full pathname,  an  attempt\r\n       is  made  to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash.\r\n       If those searches do not result in a  compspec,  any  compspec  defined\r\n       with  the -\b-D\bD option to c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be is used as the default.  If there is no\r\n       default compspec, b\bba\bas\bsh\bh attempts alias expansion on the command word  as\r\n       a  final  resort,  and attempts to find a compspec for the command word\r\n       from any successful expansion.\r\n\r\n       Once a compspec has been found, it is used  to  generate  the  list  of\r\n       matching  words.   If a compspec is not found, the default b\bba\bas\bsh\bh comple\u2010\r\n       tion as described above under C\bCo\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bti\bin\bng\bg is performed.\r\n\r\n       First, the actions specified by the compspec are  used.   Only  matches\r\n       which  are prefixed by the word being completed are returned.  When the\r\n       -\b-f\bf or -\b-d\bd option is used for filename or directory name completion,  the\r\n       shell variable F\bFI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE is used to filter the matches.\r\n\r\n       Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the -\b-G\bG op\u2010\r\n       tion are generated next.  The words generated by the pattern  need  not\r\n       match  the  word being completed.  The G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bBI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE shell variable is not\r\n       used to filter the matches, but the F\bFI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE variable is used.\r\n\r\n       Next, the string specified as the argument to the -\b-W\bW option is  consid\u2010\r\n       ered.   The  string is first split using the characters in the I\bIF\bFS\bS spe\u2010\r\n       cial variable as delimiters.  Shell quoting is honored.  Each  word  is\r\n       then  expanded  using  brace  expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and\r\n       variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion,  as\r\n       described above under E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN.  The results are split using the rules\r\n       described above under W\bWo\bor\brd\bd S\bSp\bpl\bli\bit\btt\bti\bin\bng\bg.  The results of the expansion are\r\n       prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words\r\n       become the possible completions.\r\n\r\n       After these matches have been generated, any shell function or  command\r\n       specified  with  the -\b-F\bF and -\b-C\bC options is invoked.  When the command or\r\n       function is invoked, the C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_L\bLI\bIN\bNE\bE, C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_P\bPO\bOI\bIN\bNT\bT, C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_K\bKE\bEY\bY, and C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_T\bTY\bYP\bPE\bE\r\n       variables are assigned values as described above under S\bSh\bhe\bel\bll\bl V\bVa\bar\bri\bia\bab\bbl\ble\bes\bs.\r\n       If a shell function is being invoked,  the  C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_W\bWO\bOR\bRD\bDS\bS  and  C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bP_\b_C\bCW\bWO\bOR\bRD\bD\r\n       variables  are  also set.  When the function or command is invoked, the\r\n       first argument ($\b$1\b1) is the name of the command whose arguments are  be\u2010\r\n       ing  completed,  the  second argument ($\b$2\b2) is the word being completed,\r\n       and the third argument ($\b$3\b3) is the word preceding the word  being  com\u2010\r\n       pleted on the current command line.  No filtering of the generated com\u2010\r\n       pletions against the word being completed is performed; the function or\r\n       command has complete freedom in generating the matches.\r\n\r\n       Any  function specified with -\b-F\bF is invoked first.  The function may use\r\n       any of the shell facilities, including the  c\bco\bom\bmp\bpg\bge\ben\bn  builtin  described\r\n       below,  to  generate the matches.  It must put the possible completions\r\n       in the C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bPR\bRE\bEP\bPL\bLY\bY array variable, one per array element.\r\n\r\n       Next, any command specified with the -\b-C\bC option is invoked in  an  envi\u2010\r\n       ronment  equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a list of\r\n       completions, one per line, to the standard output.   Backslash  may  be\r\n       used to escape a newline, if necessary.\r\n\r\n       After  all of the possible completions are generated, any filter speci\u2010\r\n       fied with the -\b-X\bX option is applied to the list.  The filter is  a  pat\u2010\r\n       tern  as  used  for  pathname expansion; a &\b& in the pattern is replaced\r\n       with the text of the word being completed.  A literal &\b& may be  escaped\r\n       with  a  backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.\r\n       Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the  list.\r\n       A leading !\b! negates the pattern; in this case any completion not match\u2010\r\n       ing the pattern will be removed.  If the n\bno\boc\bca\bas\bse\bem\bma\bat\btc\bch\bh  shell  option  is\r\n       enabled,  the  match  is performed without regard to the case of alpha\u2010\r\n       betic characters.\r\n\r\n       Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the -\b-P\bP and -\b-S\bS options are\r\n       added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned\r\n       to the readline completion code as the list of possible completions.\r\n\r\n       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and  the\r\n       -\b-o\bo  d\bdi\bir\brn\bna\bam\bme\bes\bs  option was supplied to c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be when the compspec was de\u2010\r\n       fined, directory name completion is attempted.\r\n\r\n       If the -\b-o\bo p\bpl\blu\bus\bsd\bdi\bir\brs\bs option was supplied to c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be  when  the  compspec\r\n       was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are\r\n       added to the results of the other actions.\r\n\r\n       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates  is  returned\r\n       to  the  completion  code as the full set of possible completions.  The\r\n       default b\bba\bas\bsh\bh completions are not attempted, and the readline default of\r\n       filename completion is disabled.  If the -\b-o\bo b\bba\bas\bsh\bhd\bde\bef\bfa\bau\bul\blt\bt option was sup\u2010\r\n       plied to c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be when the compspec was defined, the b\bba\bas\bsh\bh default  com\u2010\r\n       pletions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches.  If the -\b-o\bo\r\n       d\bde\bef\bfa\bau\bul\blt\bt option was supplied to c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be when the compspec was  defined,\r\n       readline's  default  completion will be performed if the compspec (and,\r\n       if attempted, the default b\bba\bas\bsh\bh completions) generate no matches.\r\n\r\n       When a compspec indicates that directory name  completion  is  desired,\r\n       the  programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash\r\n       to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject  to\r\n       the  value of the m\bma\bar\brk\bk-\b-d\bdi\bir\bre\bec\bct\bto\bor\bri\bie\bes\bs readline variable, regardless of the\r\n       setting of the m\bma\bar\brk\bk-\b-s\bsy\bym\bml\bli\bin\bnk\bke\bed\bd-\b-d\bdi\bir\bre\bec\bct\bto\bor\bri\bie\bes\bs readline variable.\r\n\r\n       There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.   This  is\r\n       most  useful  when used in combination with a default completion speci\u2010\r\n       fied with c\bco\bom\bmp\bpl\ble\bet\bte\be -\b-D\bD.  It's possible for shell functions  executed  as\r\n       completion  handlers  to  indicate that completion should be retried by\r\n       returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124,  and\r\n       changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is\r\n       being attempted (supplied as the first argument when  the  function  is\r\n       executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an\r\n       attempt to find a new compspec for that command.  This allows a set  of\r\n       completions  to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather\r\n       than being loaded all at once.\r\n\r\n       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each  kept\r\n       in  a  file corresponding to the name of the command, the following de\u2010\r\n       fault completion function would load completions dynamically:\r\n\r\n       _completion_loader()\r\n       {\r\n            . \"/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124\r\n       }\r\n       complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default\r\n\r\nH\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY\r\n       When the -\b-o\bo h\bhi\bis\bst\bto\bor\bry\by option to the s\bse\bet\bt builtin  is  enabled,  the  shell\r\n       provides access to the _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd _\bh_\bi_\bs_\bt_\bo_\br_\by, the list of commands previously\r\n       typed.  The value of the H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE variable is used  as  the  number  of\r\n       commands to save in a history list.  The text of the last H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE com\u2010\r\n       mands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores  each  command  in  the\r\n       history  list  prior to parameter and variable expansion (see E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the  values\r\n       of the shell variables H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE and H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTC\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL.\r\n\r\n       On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the vari\u2010\r\n       able H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE (default _\b~_\b/_\b._\bb_\ba_\bs_\bh_\b__\bh_\bi_\bs_\bt_\bo_\br_\by).  The file named by  the  value\r\n       of  H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE  is  truncated,  if necessary, to contain no more than the\r\n       number of lines specified by the value of H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bES\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE.   If  H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       S\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE  is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value\r\n       less than zero, the history file is not truncated.   When  the  history\r\n       file  is  read, lines beginning with the history comment character fol\u2010\r\n       lowed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the fol\u2010\r\n       lowing history line.  These timestamps are optionally displayed depend\u2010\r\n       ing on the value of the H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTT\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT variable.   When  a  shell  with\r\n       history  enabled  exits,  the  last $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE lines are copied from the\r\n       history list to $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE.  If the h\bhi\bis\bst\bta\bap\bpp\bpe\ben\bnd\bd shell option  is  enabled\r\n       (see  the description of s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt under S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below), the\r\n       lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history  file  is\r\n       overwritten.   If  H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE  is  unset,  or  if the history file is un\u2010\r\n       writable, the history is not saved.  If the H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTT\bTI\bIM\bME\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRM\bMA\bAT\bT variable  is\r\n       set,  time stamps are written to the history file, marked with the his\u2010\r\n       tory comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions.\r\n       This  uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from\r\n       other history lines.  After saving the history,  the  history  file  is\r\n       truncated  to contain no more than H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bES\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE lines.  If H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bES\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE\r\n       is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value  less\r\n       than zero, the history file is not truncated.\r\n\r\n       The  builtin  command f\bfc\bc (see S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS below) may be used\r\n       to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The h\bhi\bis\bs\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       t\bto\bor\bry\by  builtin may be used to display or modify the history list and ma\u2010\r\n       nipulate the history file.  When  using  command-line  editing,  search\r\n       commands  are available in each editing mode that provide access to the\r\n       history list.\r\n\r\n       The shell allows control over which commands are saved on  the  history\r\n       list.  The H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTC\bCO\bON\bNT\bTR\bRO\bOL\bL and H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE variables may be set to cause the\r\n       shell to save only a subset of the commands entered.  The c\bcm\bmd\bdh\bhi\bis\bst\bt shell\r\n       option,  if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a\r\n       multi-line command in the same history entry, adding  semicolons  where\r\n       necessary  to preserve syntactic correctness.  The l\bli\bit\bth\bhi\bis\bst\bt shell option\r\n       causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead  of\r\n       semicolons.  See the description of the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin below under S\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL\r\n       B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS for information on setting  and  unsetting  shell  op\u2010\r\n       tions.\r\n\r\nH\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY E\bEX\bXP\bPA\bAN\bNS\bSI\bIO\bON\bN\r\n       The  shell  supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the\r\n       history expansion in c\bcs\bsh\bh.

Non-interactive shells do not\r\n       perform history expansion by default.\r\n\r\n       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input\r\n       stream,  making  it  easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a\r\n       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous\r\n       commands quickly.\r\n\r\n       History  expansion  is  performed  immediately after a complete line is\r\n       read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed  on  each\r\n       line  individually  without  taking  quoting on previous lines into ac\u2010\r\n       count.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to  determine  which\r\n       line  from  the history list to use during substitution.  The second is\r\n       to select portions of that line for inclusion  into  the  current  one.\r\n       The  line  selected  from the history is the _\be_\bv_\be_\bn_\bt, and the portions of\r\n       that line that are acted upon are _\bw_\bo_\br_\bd_\bs.  Various _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bi_\bf_\bi_\be_\br_\bs are  avail\u2010\r\n       able  to  manipulate the selected words.  The line is broken into words\r\n       in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several  _\bm_\be_\bt_\ba_\bc_\bh_\ba_\br_\ba_\bc_\b\u2010\r\n       _\bt_\be_\br-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  His\u2010\r\n       tory expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history  expan\u2010\r\n       sion  character,  which is !\b! by default.  Only backslash (\\\b\\) and single\r\n       quotes can quote the history expansion character, but the  history  ex\u2010\r\n       pansion  character is also treated as quoted if it immediately precedes\r\n       the closing double quote in a double-quoted string.\r\n\r\n       Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately  fol\u2010\r\n       lowing  the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space,\r\n       tab, newline, carriage return, and =\b=.  If the e\bex\bxt\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell  option  is\r\n       enabled, (\b( will also inhibit expansion.\r\n\r\n       Several  shell  options  settable with the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin may be used to\r\n       tailor the behavior of history expansion.  If the h\bhi\bis\bst\btv\bve\ber\bri\bif\bfy\by shell  op\u2010\r\n       tion  is  enabled (see the description of the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin below), and\r\n       r\bre\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be is being  used,  history  substitutions  are  not  immediately\r\n       passed  to  the  shell  parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded\r\n       into the r\bre\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be editing buffer for further modification.  If r\bre\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be\r\n       is  being  used,  and  the h\bhi\bis\bst\btr\bre\bee\bed\bdi\bit\bt shell option is enabled, a failed\r\n       history substitution will be reloaded into the r\bre\bea\bad\bdl\bli\bin\bne\be editing  buffer\r\n       for  correction.   The  -\b-p\bp option to the h\bhi\bis\bst\bto\bor\bry\by builtin command may be\r\n       used to see what a history expansion will do before using it.   The  -\b-s\bs\r\n       option to the h\bhi\bis\bst\bto\bor\bry\by builtin may be used to add commands to the end of\r\n       the history list without actually executing  them,  so  that  they  are\r\n       available for subsequent recall.\r\n\r\n       The  shell allows control of the various characters used by the history\r\n       expansion mechanism (see the description of h\bhi\bis\bst\btc\bch\bha\bar\brs\bs above under S\bSh\bhe\bel\bll\bl\r\n       V\bVa\bar\bri\bia\bab\bbl\ble\bes\bs).   The shell uses the history comment character to mark his\u2010\r\n       tory timestamps when writing the history file.\r\n\r\n   E\bEv\bve\ben\bnt\bt D\bDe\bes\bsi\big\bgn\bna\bat\bto\bor\brs\bs\r\n       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  his\u2010\r\n       tory  list.   Unless  the reference is absolute, events are relative to\r\n       the current position in the history list.\r\n\r\n       !\b!      Start a history substitution, except when followed by  a  b\bbl\bla\ban\bnk\bk,\r\n              newline,  carriage return, = or ( (when the e\bex\bxt\btg\bgl\blo\bob\bb shell option\r\n              is enabled using the s\bsh\bho\bop\bpt\bt builtin).\r\n       !\b!_\bn     Refer to command line _\bn.\r\n       !\b!-\b-_\bn    Refer to the current command minus _\bn.\r\n       !\b!!\b!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.\r\n       !\b!_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg\r\n              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current  position\r\n              in the history list starting with _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg.\r\n       !\b!?\b?_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg[\b[?\b?]\b]\r\n              Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position\r\n              in the history list containing _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg.  The trailing  ?\b?  may  be\r\n              omitted  if  _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg  is  followed  immediately by a newline.  If\r\n              _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg is missing, the string from the  most  recent  search  is\r\n              used; it is an error if there is no previous search string.\r\n       ^\b^_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg_\b1^\b^_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg_\b2^\b^\r\n              Quick  substitution.

A :\b:\r\n       separates the event specification from the word designator.  It may  be\r\n       omitted  if  the word designator begins with a ^\b^, $\b$, *\b*, -\b-, or %\b%.  Words\r\n       are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word  being\r\n       denoted  by  0  (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line sepa\u2010\r\n       rated by single spaces.\r\n\r\n       0\b0 (\b(z\bze\ber\bro\bo)\b)\r\n              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.\r\n       _\bn      The _\bnth word.\r\n       ^\b^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.\r\n       $\b$      The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will  ex\u2010\r\n              pand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.\r\n       %\b%      The  first word matched by the most recent `?_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg?' search, if\r\n              the search string begins with a character  that  is  part  of  a\r\n              word.\r\n       _\bx-\b-_\by    A range of words; `-_\by' abbreviates `0-_\by'.\r\n       *\b*      All  of  the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `_\b1_\b-_\b$'.\r\n              It is not an error to use *\b* if there is just  one  word  in  the\r\n              event; the empty string is returned in that case.\r\n       x\bx*\b*     Abbreviates _\bx_\b-_\b$.\r\n       x\bx-\b-     Abbreviates _\bx_\b-_\b$ like x\bx*\b*, but omits the last word.  If x\bx is miss\u2010\r\n              ing, it defaults to 0.\r\n\r\n       If a word designator is supplied without an  event  specification,  the\r\n       previous command is used as the event.\r\n\r\n   M\bMo\bod\bdi\bif\bfi\bie\ber\brs\bs\r\n       After  the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of one\r\n       or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.  These mod\u2010\r\n       ify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.\r\n\r\n       h\bh      Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head.\r\n       t\bt      Remove all leading filename components, leaving the tail.\r\n       r\br      Remove a trailing suffix of the form _\b._\bx_\bx_\bx, leaving the basename.\r\n       e\be      Remove all but the trailing suffix.\r\n       p\bp      Print the new command but do not execute it.\r\n       q\bq      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.\r\n       x\bx      Quote  the  substituted words as with q\bq, but break into words at\r\n              b\bbl\bla\ban\bnk\bks\bs and newlines.  The q\bq and x\bx modifiers are mutually  exclu\u2010\r\n              sive; the last one supplied is used.\r\n       s\bs/\b/_\bo_\bl_\bd/\b/_\bn_\be_\bw/\b/\r\n              Substitute  _\bn_\be_\bw  for  the  first  occurrence of _\bo_\bl_\bd in the event\r\n              line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.\r\n              The  final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of\r\n              the event line.  The delimiter may be quoted in _\bo_\bl_\bd and _\bn_\be_\bw with\r\n              a single backslash.  If & appears in _\bn_\be_\bw, it is replaced by _\bo_\bl_\bd.\r\n              A single backslash will quote the &.  If _\bo_\bl_\bd is null, it is  set\r\n              to  the last _\bo_\bl_\bd substituted, or, if no previous history substi\u2010\r\n              tutions took place, the last _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg in  a  !\b!?\b?_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg[\b[?\b?]\b]   search.\r\n              If _\bn_\be_\bw is null, each matching _\bo_\bl_\bd is deleted.\r\n       &\b&      Repeat the previous substitution.\r\n       g\bg      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is\r\n              used in conjunction with `:\b:s\bs' (e.g.,  `:\b:g\bgs\bs/\b/_\bo_\bl_\bd/\b/_\bn_\be_\bw/\b/')  or  `:\b:&\b&'.\r\n              If  used with `:\b:s\bs', any delimiter can be used in place of /, and\r\n              the final delimiter is optional if it is the last  character  of\r\n              the event line.  An a\ba may be used as a synonym for g\bg.\r\n       G\bG      Apply the following `s\bs' or `&\b&' modifier once to each word in the\r\n              event line.\r\n\r\nS\bSH\bHE\bEL\bLL\bL B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bN C\bCO\bOM\bMM\bMA\bAN\bND\bDS\bS\r\n       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section\r\n       as accepting options preceded by -\b- accepts -\b--\b- to signify the end of the\r\n       options.

The variable C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH\r\n              defines  the  search path for the directory containing _\bd_\bi_\br: each\r\n              directory name in C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH is searched for _\bd_\bi_\br.   Alternative  di\u2010\r\n              rectory  names  in  C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH are separated by a colon (:).  A null\r\n              directory name in C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH is the same as the  current  directory,\r\n              i.e., ``.\b.''.  If _\bd_\bi_\br begins with a slash (/), then C\bCD\bDP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH is not\r\n              used.  The -\b-P\bP option causes c\bcd\bd to  use  the  physical  directory\r\n              structure  by  resolving symbolic links while traversing _\bd_\bi_\br and\r\n              before processing instances of _\b._\b. in _\bd_\bi_\br (see also the -\b-P\bP option\r\n              to the s\bse\bet\bt builtin command); the -\b-L\bL option forces symbolic links\r\n              to be followed by resolving the link after processing  instances\r\n              of _\b._\b. in _\bd_\bi_\br.  If _\b._\b. appears in _\bd_\bi_\br, it is processed by removing\r\n              the immediately previous pathname component from _\bd_\bi_\br, back to  a\r\n              slash  or  the  beginning  of _\bd_\bi_\br.  If the -\b-e\be option is supplied\r\n              with -\b-P\bP, and the current working directory  cannot  be  success\u2010\r\n              fully  determined  after  a successful directory change, c\bcd\bd will\r\n              return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that support it,  the\r\n              -\b-@\b@  option  presents  the  extended attributes associated with a\r\n              file as a directory.  An argument of -\b- is converted  to  $\b$O\bOL\bLD\bDP\bPW\bWD\bD\r\n              before the directory change is attempted.

If _\be_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is not given, the value of the  F\bFC\bCE\bED\bDI\bIT\bT\r\n              variable  is used, and the value of E\bED\bDI\bIT\bTO\bOR\bR if F\bFC\bCE\bED\bDI\bIT\bT is not set.\r\n              If neither variable is set, _\bv_\bi is used.  When  editing  is  com\u2010\r\n              plete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.\r\n\r\n              In  the  second form, _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is re-executed after each instance\r\n              of _\bp_\ba_\bt is replaced by _\br_\be_\bp.  _\bC_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is interpreted the  same  as\r\n              _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt  above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r=\"fc -s\"'',\r\n              so that typing ``r cc'' runs the  last  command  beginning  with\r\n              ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.\r\n\r\n              If  the  first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an in\u2010\r\n              valid option is encountered or _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt  or  _\bl_\ba_\bs_\bt  specify  history\r\n              lines  out  of  range.  If the -\b-e\be option is supplied, the return\r\n              value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an\r\n              error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second\r\n              form is used, the return status is that of the  command  re-exe\u2010\r\n              cuted,  unless  _\bc_\bm_\bd  does  not  specify a valid history line, in\r\n              which case f\bfc\bc returns failure.\r\n\r\n       f\bfg\bg [_\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc]\r\n              Resume _\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc in the foreground, and make it the  current  job.\r\n              If _\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc is not present, the shell's notion of the _\bc_\bu_\br_\br_\be_\bn_\bt _\bj_\bo_\bb\r\n              is used.  The return value is that of the  command  placed  into\r\n              the  foreground,  or failure if run when job control is disabled\r\n              or, when run with job control enabled, if _\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc does not spec\u2010\r\n              ify  a  valid  job  or  _\bj_\bo_\bb_\bs_\bp_\be_\bc specifies a job that was started\r\n              without job control.\r\n\r\n       g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be [_\ba_\br_\bg _\b._\b._\b.]\r\n              g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs is used by shell procedures to parse positional  parame\u2010\r\n              ters.   _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg  contains  the  option characters to be recog\u2010\r\n              nized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is  ex\u2010\r\n              pected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by\r\n              white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not  be\r\n              used  as  option  characters.   Each time it is invoked, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs\r\n              places the next option in the shell variable _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be,  initializing\r\n              _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to\r\n              be processed into the variable O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD.  O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD is initialized to\r\n              1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an op\u2010\r\n              tion requires an argument, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs places that argument into the\r\n              variable O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG.  The shell does not reset O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD automatically;\r\n              it must be manually reset  between  multiple  calls  to  g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs\r\n              within  the  same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is\r\n              to be used.\r\n\r\n              When the end of options is encountered, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs exits with a re\u2010\r\n              turn value greater than zero.  O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD is set to the index of the\r\n              first non-option argument, and _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is set to ?.\r\n\r\n              g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs normally parses the positional parameters, but  if  more\r\n              arguments  are  supplied as _\ba_\br_\bg values, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs parses those in\u2010\r\n              stead.\r\n\r\n              g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs can report errors in two ways.  If the  first  character\r\n              of  _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg  is  a  colon, _\bs_\bi_\bl_\be_\bn_\bt error reporting is used.  In\r\n              normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed  when  invalid\r\n              options  or  missing  option  arguments are encountered.  If the\r\n              variable O\bOP\bPT\bTE\bER\bRR\bR is set to 0, no  error  messages  will  be  dis\u2010\r\n              played, even if the first character of _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg is not a colon.\r\n\r\n              If an invalid option is seen, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs places ? into _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be and, if\r\n              not silent, prints an  error  message  and  unsets  O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG.   If\r\n              g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs  is  silent, the option character found is placed in O\bOP\bP\u2010\b\u2010\r\n              T\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG and no diagnostic message is printed.\r\n\r\n              If a required argument is not found, and g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs is not  silent,\r\n              a  question  mark  (?\b?) is placed in _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG is unset, and a\r\n              diagnostic message is printed.  If g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs  is  silent,  then  a\r\n              colon  (:\b:)  is  placed  in  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be and O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG is set to the option\r\n              character found.\r\n\r\n              g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs returns true if an option, specified or unspecified,  is\r\n              found.  It returns false if the end of options is encountered or\r\n              an error occurs.\r\n\r\n       h\bha\bas\bsh\bh [-\b-l\blr\br] [-\b-p\bp _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be] [-\b-d\bdt\bt] [_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be]\r\n              Each time h\bha\bas\bsh\bh is invoked, the full pathname of the command _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be\r\n              is  determined  by searching the directories in $\b$P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH and remem\u2010\r\n              bered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded.  If the\r\n              -\b-p\bp option is supplied, no path search is performed, and _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be\r\n              is used as the full filename of  the  command.   The  -\b-r\br  option\r\n              causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.  The -\b-d\bd op\u2010\r\n              tion causes the shell to forget the remembered location of  each\r\n              _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.   If the -\b-t\bt option is supplied, the full pathname to which\r\n              each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be corresponds is printed.  If  multiple  _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be  arguments\r\n              are supplied with -\b-t\bt, the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is printed before the hashed full\r\n              pathname.

There is only one current compatibility\r\n       level -- each option is mutually exclusive.  The compatibility level is\r\n       intended  to allow users to select behavior from previous versions that\r\n       is incompatible with newer versions while they migrate scripts  to  use\r\n       current  features  and  behavior. It's intended to be a temporary solu\u2010\r\n       tion.\r\n\r\n       This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a  particu\u2010\r\n       lar  version  (e.g., setting c\bco\bom\bmp\bpa\bat\bt3\b32\b2 means that quoting the rhs of the\r\n       regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the  word,\r\n       which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and above).\r\n\r\n       If  a  user enables, say, c\bco\bom\bmp\bpa\bat\bt3\b32\b2, it may affect the behavior of other\r\n       compatibility levels up to  and  including  the  current  compatibility\r\n       level.   The  idea  is  that each compatibility level controls behavior\r\n       that changed in that version of b\bba\bas\bsh\bh, but that behavior may  have  been\r\n       present  in  earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-\r\n       based comparisons with the [\b[[\b[ command came  in  bash-4.1,  and  earlier\r\n       versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling c\bco\bom\bmp\bpa\bat\bt3\b32\b2 will enable\r\n       ASCII-based comparisons as well.  That granularity may  not  be  suffi\u2010\r\n       cient  for  all uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility\r\n       levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular  feature  to\r\n       find out the current behavior.\r\n\r\n       Bash-4.3  introduced  a new shell variable: B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bPA\bAT\bT.  The value as\u2010\r\n       signed to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an inte\u2010\r\n       ger  corresponding to the c\bco\bom\bmp\bpa\bat\bt_\bN_\bN option, like 42) determines the com\u2010\r\n       patibility level.\r\n\r\n       Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older  compatibility\r\n       levels.   Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_C\bCO\bOM\bM\u2010\b\u2010\r\n       P\bPA\bAT\bT.\r\n\r\n       Bash-5.0 is the final version for which there  will  be  an  individual\r\n       shopt  option for the previous version. Users should use B\bBA\bAS\bSH\bH_\b_C\bCO\bOM\bMP\bPA\bAT\bT on\r\n       bash-5.0 and later versions.\r\n\r\n       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled  by  each\r\n       compatibility level setting.  The c\bco\bom\bmp\bpa\bat\bt_\bN_\bN tag is used as shorthand for\r\n       setting the compatibility level to _\bN_\bN using one of the following mecha\u2010\r\n       nisms.
